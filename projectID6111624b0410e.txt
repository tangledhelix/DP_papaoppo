PREFACE


The following pages have been written to show the
difficulties experienced by Roman Catholics in assenting
to the doctrine of Papal Infallibility. No attempt
is here made to write a complete account of the
Vatican Council. Indeed, many subjects discussed in
that Assembly are entirely omitted. Our interest is
with one doctrine alone. What is attempted is, simply
to sketch the inner history of Roman opposition to
the dogma in different countries and several centuries,
until and after the memorable Decree of 18th July 1870.
We are simply concerned to show the process by which
a very considerable section of Bishops, priests, and
laity in the Roman Church were constrained to pass
from one belief to its opposite.

The literature of the subject is, of course, immense.
A considerable part of the details here recorded have
never appeared in English before. They lie buried in
enormous German treatises, or in the vast official Acta
of the Council; or in the documentary collections of
Cecconi, Von Schulte, Friedrich, Friedberg, and many
others; or in scattered pamphlets and periodicals to
which access is now by no means easily obtained.

The materials for a history of the opposition to the
doctrine have of recent years largely increased. All
-----File: f006.png--------------------------------------------------------
the principal actors in the Vatican disputes have, by
this time, passed away; and a large series of biographies
have placed at our disposal private letters never published
while they lived.

But it will be obvious that an Ultramontane
biographer of a Bishop who vehemently opposed the
doctrine may be gravely perplexed between the conflicting
claims of history and of edification. His loyalty
to truth, his reverence for the personage of whom he
writes, his regard for living authority, with its tremendous
powers to revise, cancel, or condemn, his proper disinclination
to scandalise the faithful by rigorous records
of episcopal unbelief, or to reveal the family disunions
before an incredulous world--are elements which, when
they coexist, may, even in the sincerest mind possibly
blend together in very various proportions. At any rate
the biographies of certain great French Bishops of
the Vatican struggle manifest marked reluctance and
hesitation in recording fully the facts. And even when
the facts have been fairly fully recorded, the English
translator has--for whatever reasons--condensed them,
we had almost said mutilated them, beyond recognition.

The recently published selection of Lord Acton's
letters has increased our knowledge of his attitude
toward the Infallibility Decree; but the entire omission
of correspondence during ten most critical years of
the struggle suggests, what other considerations endorse,
that there is yet considerably more remaining unrevealed.

Still, with whatever drawbacks, the resources at a
writer's disposal to-day are vastly greater than they
were some years ago.
-----File: f007.png--------------------------------------------------------

Accordingly the following pages are written under
a strong sense that the material is ample, that the
history of the minority has never yet for English people
been fully told, and with a desire to supply the omission.

It should be added that the adverse criticisms herein
repeated are almost entirely derived from Roman
Catholic sources, and are, as far as possible, given
in the actual words. Protestant criticism has been
systematically excluded. The object being simply to
describe how the doctrine of Pontifical Infallibility
appeared; what difficulties, intellectual, historic, and
moral, it created; what fierce and desperate strife its
increasing ascendency awakened; how, and with what
results, moral and intellectual, it was finally regarded,
not by the outer world, nor by other religious communions,
but by clergy and laity within the limits of
the Roman Catholic Church.

Since these pages have passed through the press,
Turmel's <i>Histoire du Dogme de la Papauté</i> has been
placed upon the Roman Index of prohibited books
(5th July 1909). It is therefore among that lengthy
list of modern writings which no member of the Roman
Obedience may "dare to read or retain." The interests
of edification are conceived by Authority as incompatible
with those of historical research. Such procedure
deprives the historian of that freedom to report
results without which history cannot be written.

The author desires to express his deep indebtedness
to the kindness of the Reverend Darwell Stone,
Librarian of the Pusey House, who has read through
the proof sheets of this book. He is of course in no
-----File: f008.png--------------------------------------------------------
way responsible for its contents; but it has been the
greatest privilege to have the encouragement and aid
of so critical and learned an adviser.

<tb>

<sc>Note.</sc>--The number of Bishops who, though resident
in Rome, absented themselves from the Vatican Council
on the day of the Decree is variously given on page 268
as 91, on page 271 as 70, and on page 281 as more
than 80. It will be noticed that these variations are
due to the authors quoted; the first being that given
by Quirinus; the second by the letter of the Opposition
to the Pope; the third by Dr Newman.

LIST OF AUTHORITIES


The following list of books has been compiled, partly
to show the editions to which references have been
made, and partly as a help to study. It is, of course,
needless to say that such a list has no pretensions
whatever to completeness.

ROMAN CATHOLIC OPPOSITION
TO PAPAL INFALLIBILITY




CHAPTER I

THE EVIDENCE OF SCRIPTURE


Those who do not identify history with heresy will
always desire to know how a Christian affirmation of
the present compares with the past. Whatever validity
faith may attach to the teaching of the Church of to-day,
there must be reasons and reasons which demand and
justify an enquiry into the doctrine of other ages. If
serious discrepancies would cause perplexity, unforeseen
harmonies would confirm. In any case the refusal to
examine is not the product of a genuine faith. For,
after all, history is, if on one side human, on another
divine. Moreover, the actual development of human
thought must be of profoundest living interest. This
enquiry, then, must be undertaken in reference to the
doctrine of Papal Infallibility. For it is, in a large
portion of modern Christian life, an existing affirmation.
The question is, What relation does the doctrine bear
to the facts of History? And obviously, first of all,
what does Scripture say?

The Ultramontane, so far as he founds the doctrine
on Scripture language, finds it chiefly in the words of
-----File: p002.png--------------------------------------------------------
our Lord to St Peter: "I have prayed for thee, that thy
faith fail not; and when thou art converted, strengthen
thy brethren."[1] Now seeing that this dogma of Papal
Infallibility would be, if true, no less than fundamental,
it is necessary to dwell at length on the asserted
scriptural witness to the same. For those who believe
that fundamental Christian truth must be traceable to
the records of Revelation must test each doctrine by
what is told them there. And we are here concerned
with the express words of Christ. And the issues
which depend on a right understanding of the
Redeemer's words are, as all Christians will acknowledge,
momentous.

The Roman interpretation of this passage maintains
the following points:--

1. That Christ here confers on Peter an exclusive
prerogative, on the ground of Peter's superior position;

2. That this prerogative is infallible insight;

3. That thereby he was enabled to give infallible
instructions to his brethren;

4. That this prerogative extends to all Peter's successors
and to none but those--the prerogative being as
exclusive in its range as it was in its origin.

There is, however, another interpretation which has
been in substance and in many details accepted by
members of the Roman Church, and which is unable
to find any of these doctrines in the words of Christ.

There are clearly four points to be considered:
Christ's Prayer; Peter's Faith; Peter's Brethren;
Peter's Successors.

/#

1. Certainly it was an <i>exclusive</i> prayer. Satan hath
desired to have you, collectively; but I have prayed

[Footnote 1: Luke xxii. 32.]
-----File: p003.png--------------------------------------------------------
for thee, Peter, individually. Christ here prays for the
one: for the others, on this occasion, He does not pray.

Does not this imply, asks the Ultramontane, the
superiority of the individual thus selected and distinguished?
Does not Christ here place the security
of the many in the security of the one? If the leader
and chief is protected, those who follow him and obey
him will be secure. This exposition labours under the
double defect of assuming a theory of Peter's supremacy
and of ignoring the historical circumstances which
prompted Christ's words. That the prayer was exclusive
is true. But exclusive petition does not necessarily
imply the greater superiority of the person prayed
for; it may equally well imply his greater need.
Remembering that Peter alone was on the verge of a
triple denial, no wonder he became the object of an
exclusive prayer. If his confident self-reliance, together
with his impulsive temperament, laid him open to perils
from which the Twelve were exempt, what else could
his Master do than offer special intercession for
him? To build a theory of permanent prerogative as
universal teacher on the fact of Christ's exclusive
petition is therefore to forget that the historic circumstances,
which elicited our Lord's concern, suggest a
totally different explanation.

2. Moreover, while we are reminded that Christ's
prayer was exclusive, we should also be reminded that
it was <i>conditional</i>.

It seems at first sight a natural outcome of Christian
piety to assume that whatever Christ prayed for
was certain to come to pass. Is it not written, "I know
that thou hearest me always"? But the effectiveness
of Christ's prayers must take into account our human
independence. To say that the prayer of Christ must
necessarily realise its design, is really to reduce mankind
-----File: p004.png--------------------------------------------------------
to a mechanism upon which the Spirit plays. But
this is false to Christian teaching and human experience.
The prayers of Christ are invariably conditional upon
the human response. They demand human co-operation.
The prayer for Peter unquestionably implies that the
resources needed to discharge his function would be
placed at his disposal, provided that he yielded his
will to the offered grace. But that Peter would invariably
fulfil the essential conditions, Christ's petition does
not affirm and cannot even suggest. It cannot mean
unconditional security, exemption from the liabilities
of human weakness and imperfection, apart from all
considerations of personal effort and moral state.

/#
ii. <i>The second object for our analysis is Peter's Faith--and
here two points arise:--What is meant by "faith"
and what is meant by "fail."</i>
#/

1. Now when our Lord says "faith," the meaning is
in general not difficult to ascertain. The faith which, if
present, could remove mountains, or, if absent, hinders
His merciful works, is plainly not so much an intellectual
assent to a number of propositions, as a moral relation
to a Person; a devotion to Himself, demanding qualities,
not only of the intellect, but also of the affections and
of the will. It is a quality inseparable from love. It
may exist in many varying degrees.

2. What, then, is meant by "fail"? The Greek term
here translated "fail" sometimes describes an eclipse,
which to the primitive imagination suggested death,
much as we talk of the dying day. "Thou art the
same and thy years shall not fail,"[1] means shall not
cease, or come to an end.

3. Accordingly, by "a faith which should not fail,"

[Footnote 1: Heb. i. 12.]
-----File: p005.png--------------------------------------------------------
our Lord described a personal devotion to Himself,
which should never cease to exist. But we must carefully
distinguish between the inward quality of faith
and its outward expressions. St Peter, in the subsequent
denial, failed; not in his inward belief, but its outward
expression. The failure was not in his thoughts
but in his words. As a fact, his outward expressions of
faith were not protected from error. He said exactly
what his intellect contradicted, what he knew was
false. The natural inference is that the prayer of
Christ was concerned with Peter's inward spiritual
state, not with the outward phrases. A very able Roman
writer saw this plainly enough. Consequently, he says,
Christ demanded here for Peter <i>two</i> privileges--not
merely one: first, that he should never lose his faith;
secondly, that as Pope he should never teach anything
contrary to the faith. That is what the Ultramontane
position would require. But that is exactly what did
not happen at the denial. The prayer of Christ did
not secure St Peter from false expressions. Nor did
it secure Peter's personal devotion from a temporary
eclipse. But even if Peter's dogmatic insight remained
unclouded, that would help his brethren comparatively
little if his official utterances could be mistaken. And
it was expressly in his utterances that he did fail.

/#
iii. <i>The third theme for analysis is the Strengthening
his Brethren.</i>
#/

1. Now to strengthen is to give support. It is
employed several times by St Paul. As when he says:
"I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some
spiritual gift, to the end ye may be <i>established</i>."[1] He
says he sent Timothy "to establish you, and to comfort
you concerning your faith."[2] He speaks of "stablishing
your hearts unblameable in holiness";[3] prays that

[Footnote 1: Rom. i. 11.]

[Footnote 2: 1 Thess. iii. 2.]

[Footnote 3: 1 Thess. iii. 13.]
-----File: p006.png--------------------------------------------------------
God will "comfort your hearts and stablish you in
every good word and work";[1] and says "the Lord is
faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from
evil."[2] So St Peter desires that God would "stablish,
strengthen, settle"[3] the Christian; and says that
Christians are "established in the present truth."[4]
The Revelation of St John again says: "Be watchful
and strengthen the things which remain, which are
ready to die."[5]

This scriptural use of the term "strengthen," or
"stablish," shows conclusively that any kind of moral
support may be intended. The strengthening may be
that which Divine Grace supplies; or that which comes
from the knowledge of the Truth; or that which comes
from the encouragement of Christian ministers. But in
no solitary instance is there any suggestion of infallibility
as essential to enable one to be a strengthener.
Thus, "when thou art converted, strengthen thy
brethren," would naturally mean, When thou hast by
repentance recovered from thine own moral infirmity,
do thou become a moral support to the impulsive and
the weak. It is a merciful promise to St Peter before
his sin, of restoration to Apostleship after the sin had
been committed. It suggests that even through the
denial he may gain a humility and self-knowledge
which may enlarge his sympathies and increase his
strength. It is all in the moral rather than in the
purely intellectual sphere.

2. But further: The utterance, "strengthen thy
brethren," is a command and not a promise. We
cannot infer, from a duty enjoined, its invariable fulfilment.
Otherwise, we are all perfect: For this command
is laid upon us all. Moreover, whatever Peter

[Footnote 1: 2 Thess. ii. 17.]

[Footnote 2: 2 Thess. iii. 3.]

[Footnote 3: 1 Peter v. 10.]

[Footnote 4: 2 Peter i. 12.]

[Footnote 5: Apoc. iii. 2.]
-----File: p007.png--------------------------------------------------------
may have done, what is certain is that at Antioch he did
not strengthen his brethren. All human analogy would
suggest a more or less imperfect human endeavour to
fulfil a divinely appointed ideal.

/#
iv. <i>The fourth and last point for consideration is Peters
Successors.</i>
#/

1. Now, first, our Lord does not mention them. They
are not mentioned even by implication. There is no
necessary implication, unless we assume, <i>à priori</i>, as
some Roman writers do, that such a prerogative could
not be restricted to a single generation, nor to the
Apostolic Age;[1] and therefore that the function of
Peter in strengthening his brethren must be continued
to his successors to the end of time. But by no process
of interpretation can this be derived from the words of
Christ. It can be read into them: it cannot be read
out of them. Whether false or true, it is certainly
not what our Lord has said.

Moreover, since the prerogative here conferred on
Peter was the prerogative of sympathy learnt by the
humiliations of failure, not the gift of Infallibility, its
perpetuation among his successors could not confer upon
them what it did not confer on him. If our exposition
of this prayer of Christ be correct, the extension of the
prerogative over a series of successors would be doubtless
morally valuable but of no dogmatic use.

2. Moreover, if the words, "strengthen thy brethren,"
apply to Peter's successors, so do the words "when thou
art converted." Bellarmine himself saw this, and was
disturbed by it. He suggested that "converted" must not
be understood as moral renovation and repentance, but
as an adverb equivalent to, "in turn," as if the passage

[Footnote 1: So Vat. C., cf. <i>Knabenbauer in Luc.</i>]
-----File: p008.png--------------------------------------------------------
ran--I have strengthened thee, do thou in thy turn
strengthen thy brethren. Or else it might mean--so it
was suggested--Having turned your attention to them,
exercise your Infallibility. But even if the sentence,
"when thou art converted," bore no allusion to Peter's
denial, still no possible exegesis can justly elicit the
Infallibility of his successors out of the injunction
"strengthen thy brethren." Peter's successors would be
thereby ordered to bestow moral support upon their
weaker brethren. But whether they would obey this
command and fulfil it with more invariable exactitude
than he to whom it was spoken, is a question of historical
investigation and not of <i>à priori</i> theory.

<tb>

The preceding exposition has been very largely
derived from Roman Catholic sources; from the
writings of Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux, opposing, in
behalf of the Church of France, the Ultramontanism
of the seventeenth century; of Barral, Archbishop of
Tours, in the early nineteenth century; of Bishop
Maret, and of Gratry, just before the Vatican Council
of 1870; of Döllinger, prior to the rupture with Rome;
of Archbishop Kenrick of St Louis, in the speech
which he intended to deliver in the Vatican Council,
in exercise of his divine right as a Bishop, but whose
delivery was prevented by the closure of the discussion.

CHAPTER II

THE AGE OF THE FATHERS


Roman writers have differed greatly in their view of
the Patristic evidence for Papal Infallibility. Some
have found very little definite statement in the Fathers,
upon which they thought it wise, at any rate in controversy,
to rely.

Cardinal Bellarmine[1] makes but scanty appeal for
this doctrine to the Age of the Fathers. He contents
himself with asserting first that the Patriarchal Churches
of Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch have been
presided over by heretics, whereas Rome has been
exempt from this calamity;[2] and secondly, he observes
that Popes have passed judgment on heresies apart from
any Council, and that their decisions have been accepted.
This asserted exemption of the Roman Church from
heresy he claims as identical with impossibility of
heresy; and this acceptance of decisions as an acknowledgment
of Infallibility. Bellarmine's meagre use of
the Patristic period to prove the doctrine of Papal
Infallibility is strikingly contrasted with his ample use
of the same to prove the primacy or the authority of
the Roman See. And this difference of appeal in the
two cases means a capacity to distinguish between
authority and Infallibility.

Other writers have seen Infallibility implied in every

[Footnote 1: See <i>Controv.</i>]

[Footnote 2: Cf. Turmel, <i>Hist. Theol.[**typo for Théol.?] Positive</i>, p. 303.]
-----File: p010.png--------------------------------------------------------
recognition of authority or primacy; in every judicial
sentence of the Roman See.

A third section of Roman theologians has been
definitely unable to discover the doctrine anywhere in
the Patristic period. Among the more critical and
historically-minded of recent Roman writers there is a
belief in the doctrine, independent of any evidence for it
in the Age of the Fathers; indeed often coupled with
an acknowledgment that the period does not yield to
their scrutiny instances either of its recognition as a
principle, or of its exercise as a fact. Advancing to the
Patristic times with the definition of Infallibility as given
in the Vatican Decree, they affirm that one essential
condition of its exercise is deliberate intention to
instruct the Universal Church. All instruction not
given with that express intention is entirely outside the
range of Infallibility. Evidently the great mass of
judicial decisions, appeals to Rome, recognitions of its
authority, praises of its impartiality and rectitude, assertions
of the danger of disobedience to its words, have
nothing to do with the doctrine of Infallibility; and
are acknowledged by this school of Roman writers to
be no proof of the doctrine's existence. This recent
Roman attitude involves an entirely different estimate
of Patristic evidence from that formerly prevalent
among the Ultramontanes. It brings the Ultramontane
curiously round to agreement with the opposite school
as to the actual contents of the Patristic period. There
is far less readiness to-day than formerly to assume that
inferences which appear to a modern Ultramontane necessarily
obviously involved in a statement or a claim, were
really actually seen and understood and accepted among
the primitive writers by whom the statement or claim was
made. This is a sign of a more historic spirit, and
therefore exceedingly hopeful.
-----File: p011.png--------------------------------------------------------

Of course the doctrine's recognition as a theory is
separable from its exercise as a fact. Many Roman
Catholic writers have not only maintained that during
the Age of the Fathers no case occurs of its exercise;
but that the principles advocated demonstrate that
it was not even recognised as a theory, since by
those very principles it is actually excluded. Roman
opponents of the doctrine have also pointed out that
no profession of belief in the infallibility of the Church
can be adduced to prove belief in the infallibility of
the Pope for the simple reason that many Roman
theologians who believed the former have rejected the
latter.

All that can be done in a limited space is to select
the chief examples of the Patristic teaching; and then
to show how the Ultramontanes and their opponents
employed them.

1. A crucial instance is the famous language of St
Irenæus:--

/#
"It is within the power of all, who may wish to see
the truth, to contemplate clearly the tradition of the
Apostles manifested throughout the world in every
Church; and we are able to enumerate those whom
the Apostles appointed to be Bishops in the churches,
and their successors, quite down to our time, who
neither taught nor knew anything like what these
[heretics] rave about. Yet surely if the Apostles had
known any hidden mysteries, which they were in the
habit of teaching to the perfect apart and privily
from the rest, they would have taken special care to
deliver them to those to whom they were also committing
the churches themselves.... But because
it would be too long in such a volume as this, to
enumerate the successions of all the churches, we point
to the tradition of the very great and very ancient and
universally known Church which was founded and
#/
-----File: p012.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
established at Rome by the two most glorious Apostles,
Peter and Paul;--we point, I say, to the tradition which
this Church has from the Apostles, and to her faith
proclaimed to man, which comes down to our time
through the succession of her Bishops.... For to this
Church, on account of its more influential pre-eminence,
it is necessary that every church should resort--that is
to say, the faithful who are from all quarters; and in this
Church the tradition, which comes from the Apostles,
has ever been preserved by those who are from all
quarters."[1]
#/

This classic passage, says a Roman writer,[2] proves
how universal was the belief in the Sovereign Pontiff's
Infallibility. It does not merely state a fact: it enunciates
a principle. Accordance with the traditional
doctrine of the Church of Rome is here stated to be
the duty of all churches. But how could this be so,
unless the Pope was the infallible organ of Apostolic
teaching? The holy martyr calls, says another, the
faithful of the entire Christian world to the Roman
Church, that they may drink in the Apostolic truth
without fear of error or misleading.[3] What else is this
but infallible authority?[4]

On the other side a Roman historian of dogmas
writes:--

/#
"Irenæus was not contemplating the case of contradictions
between churches founded by the Apostles....
There existed at that period complete agreement in
faith and doctrine. Consequently, the Fathers had no
cause to consider a case of disagreement between
Apostolic churches."[5]
#/

According to the French Bishop Maret,[6] the principle

[Footnote 1: St Irenæus, III. iii. pp. 1-2, trans. F. Puller, p. 20.]

[Footnote 2: Botalla, i. p. 79.]

[Footnote 3: Perrone, p. 38.]

[Footnote 4: Cf. Bellarmine, p. 267.]

[Footnote 5: Schwane, <i>Histoire du Dogme</i>, i. p. 667.]

[Footnote 6: Maret, <i>Du Concile Général</i>, ii. p. 110.]
-----File: p013.png--------------------------------------------------------
laid down by Irenæus is an appeal to tradition manifested
in all the Apostolic churches. He considers that
truth is to be found in the tradition manifested in all
the Apostolic foundations. But for the sake of brevity
it is enough to consult the tradition of the Roman
Church. Maret acknowledges a primacy in the Roman
Church, but cannot believe that Irenæus would disallow
the rightfulness of consulting the tradition of the
Universal Church in which Irenæus himself considers
the Truth is found.

Gratry, in his famous letters during the Vatican
Council, goes further than this, for he quotes the
sequel to the passage of Irenæus, and underlines the
statement which shows that the principle which this
primitive writer considers Catholic is an appeal to the
ancient Churches (plural) and by no means exclusive
appeal to one.

/#
"... It is not then necessary to seek elsewhere the
truth, since it is easily found <i>in the Church, the Apostles</i>
having made <i>of the Church</i> a rich bank, in which they
have amassed all the treasures of truth; so that every
man, whosoever will, can draw from her the water of
life.... Thus if a dispute should arise relative to a
detail of tradition, should we not have recourse to <i>the
most ancient Churches</i> (<i>nonne oporteret</i> in antiquissimas
recurrere Ecclesias, <i>in quibus Apostoli conversati sunt</i>) in
which the Apostles themselves have lived, and learn
from them immediately what is certain and clear upon
the question?"[1]
#/

Upon this passage Gratry observes:--

/#
"The reader has here before him the whole doctrine
of St Irenæus upon this subject. This doctrine is
perfectly clear. It is almost the same as that of
Tertullian, who says: 'Run over the Apostolic Churches,
#/

[Footnote 1: Gratry's second letter.]
-----File: p014.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
in which are found the chairs of the Apostles, upon
which are seated the Bishops who succeeded them, in
which are still read their authentic letters, each echoing
the voice and representing the face of its author. Is
Achaia near to thee? Thou hast Corinth. Art thou
near Macedonia? Thou hast Philippi; thou hast the
Thessalonians. If thou canst travel into Asia, thou
hast Ephesus. If thou art near to Italy, thou hast
Rome, where we can find also authority at hand.'"
#/

The thesis of St Irenæus, adds Gratry, is this:--We
must bring back heretics "to the tradition of the
Apostles, which, by their successors, is preserved in
the Churches." And "when there is any doubt, we
must have recourse to the Ancient Churches."

<tb>

2. In the case of St Cyprian (<sc>A.D.</sc> 250) special
difficulties arise owing to controversies on the actual
text. We can only set down the chief passage and
afterwards indicate the use made of his principles
by Roman opponents of Infallibility.

/#
"And although after His resurrection He assigns
equal power to all His Apostles, ... nevertheless, in
order to make the unity manifest, He <i>established one
Chair and</i> by His own authority appointed the origin
of that same unity beginning from one. Certainly the
rest of the Apostles were that which Peter <i>also</i> was,
endued with equal partnership, both of honour and
office, but the beginning sets out from unity, <i>and
Primacy is given to Peter, that one Church of Christ and
one Chair may be pointed out; and all are pastors and
one flock is shown, to be fed by all the Apostles with one-hearted
accord</i>, that one Church of Christ may be
pointed out.... He that holds not this unity of the
Church, does he believe that he holds the faith? He,
who strives and rebels against the Church, <i>he who</i>
#/
-----File: p015.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
<i>deserts the Chair of Peter on which the Church was
founded</i>, does he trust that he is in the Church?"[1]
#/

Whether the passages underlined are Cyprian's or
unauthorised interpolations, is the critical difficulty.
They appear in the earlier printed editions, not, however,
without editorial misgivings. But the modern
critical text[2] omits them. Many Roman theologians
do the same. Leo XIII. himself omits them in his
Encyclical on the unity of the Church. On the other
hand, their genuineness is still asserted by certain
Protestant and Roman writers. In any case all that
they affirm is a Primacy. No modern Romanist of the
historical school would quote them as affirming infallibility.
Under these circumstances perhaps it will be
best to confine attention to words whose genuineness no
one disputes. The Ultramontane emphasised Cyprian's
statements on the Primacy: the opposing school, his
statements on Episcopal equality. The former quoted
"the principal Church, whence sacerdotal unity arose";
the latter "the episcopate is one, it is a whole, in which
each enjoys full possession"; and again, "the rest of the
Apostles were that which Peter was, endowed with equal
partnership, both of honour and office."

Minority Bishops asserted in the Vatican Council, on
the ground of these two passages, that Ecclesiastical
power was divinely entrusted to Peter and to the other
Apostles; and that it was derived from them to their
successors by Divine institution. Accordingly the
minority complained that the exclusive consideration
of Papal authority was irreconcilable with Catholic
truth and Cyprianic principles. The equal authority
of the episcopate deserved and required an equal

[Footnote 1: Cyprian, <i>De Unit.</i> 4.]

[Footnote 2: Text of the <i>Vienna Corpus</i>, ed. Hartel.]
-----File: p016.png--------------------------------------------------------
exposition.[1] Cyprian's inference from St Matt. xvi. 18
was that "the Church should be built upon the Bishops,
and that every act of the Church should be guided by
them as presidents."[2]

And this is the principle upon which Cyprian acts.
After assembling the local Bishops and forming their
own decision, Cyprian wrote to Stephen, Bishop of
Rome, in the following terms:--

/#
"These considerations, dear brother, we bring home
to your conscience out of regard to the office we hold
in common, and to the simple love we bear you. We
believe that you, too, from the reality of your religious
feeling and faith, approve what is religious as well as
true. Nevertheless, we know there are those who cannot
readily part with principles once imbibed, or easily
alter a view of their own, but who, without hurting the
bond of peace and concord between colleagues, hold to
special practices once adopted among them, and herein
we do no violence to any one and impose no law. For,
in the administration of the Church each several prelate
has the free discretion of his own will--having to account
to the Lord for his action."[3]
#/

Quoting Cyprian's own words St Augustine repeats
the passage from a letter:--

/#
"For neither did Peter whom the Lord chose first,
and on whom He built His Church, when Paul afterwards
disputed with him about circumcision, claim or assume
anything and arrogantly to himself, so as to say that
he held the primacy, and should rather be obeyed by
newcomers. Nor did he despise Paul because he had
before been a persecutor of the Church, but he admitted
the counsel of truth, and readily assented to the
legitimate grounds which Paul maintained; giving us
thereby a pattern of concord and patience, that we should
not pertinaciously love our own opinions, but should
#/

[Footnote 1: Friedrich, <i>Documenta</i>.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ep.</i> xxxiii.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Ep.</i> xlvii. 3.]
-----File: p017.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
rather account as our own any true and rightful suggestions
of our brethren and colleagues for the common
health and weal."[1]
#/

Upon this Augustine's comment is:--

/#
"Here is a passage in which Cyprian records what
we also learn in Holy Scripture, that the Apostle Peter,
in whom the primacy of the Apostles shines with such
exceeding grace, was corrected by the later Apostle
Paul, when he adopted a custom in the matter of
circumcision at variance with the demand of truth....[2]

"Wherefore the holy Cyprian, whose dignity is only
increased by his humility, who so loves the pattern
set by Peter as to use the words; 'giving us thereby
a pattern of concord and patience, that we should not
pertinaciously love our own opinions, but should rather
account as our own any true and rightful suggestions
of our brethren and colleagues for the common health
and weal'--he, I say, abundantly shows that he was
most willing to correct his own opinion, if any one should
prove to him that it is as certain that the baptism of
Christ can be given by those who have strayed from the
fold, as that it could not be lost when they strayed....
Nor should we ourselves venture to assert anything
of the kind were we not supported by the unanimous
authority of the whole Church--to which he himself
would unquestionably have yielded, if at that time
the truth of this question had been placed beyond
dispute by the investigation and decree of a General
Council. For if he quotes Peter as an example for his
allowing himself quietly and peacefully to be corrected
by one junior colleague, how much more readily would
he himself, with the Council of his Province, have yielded
to the authority of the whole world, when the truth
had been thus brought to light? For, indeed, so holy
and peaceful a soul would have been more ready to
assent to the arguments of any single person who could

[Footnote 1: Cyprian, <i>Ep.</i> lxxi.]

[Footnote 2: Augustine, <i>De Baptismo</i>, II. i. 2.]
-----File: p018.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
prove to him the truth; and perhaps he even did so,
though we have no knowledge of the fact."[1]
#/

To Cardinal Bellarmine, Jesuit of the sixteenth
century, the persistent refusal of Cyprian to accept
the Pope's teachings appeared very grave indeed.
Cyprian, says Bellarmine, was not a heretic, because
those who say that the Pope can err are not even
yet considered manifestly heretics. But whether
Cyprian did not commit a mortal sin in disobeying
the Pope, Bellarmine is not sure. On the one hand,
Cyprian sinned in ignorance. Thinking the Pope in
serious error, he was obliged to disobey; for no man
ought to go against his conscience--and a Council of
eighty Bishops agreed with him. On the other hand,
he appears to have mortally sinned, for he disobeyed
an apostolic precept, and refused to submit to the
judgment of his superior.

Archbishop Kenrick's dogmatic inference from these
facts in the Vatican Council was as follows:--

/#
"When Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage, held mistaken
views as to the rebaptism of heretics upon their return
to the Church, and had strenuously defended them
against the Roman Pontiff Stephen, Augustine considered
him to be justified: because the matter in
question had not yet been elucidated by the authority
of a General Council. Thus Augustine did not regard
as decisive the Roman Pontiff's opinion which had
already condemned this error, and by which, according
to my opponents, the dispute had been already infallibly
determined. Augustine therefore was ignorant of the
doctrine of Pontifical Infallibility. Had he acknowledged
it, it must have followed that Cyprian was not
only indefensible for his conduct, but had actually
incurred condemnation for heresy."

[**possible TB - F1]3. From the writings of St Augustine probably no
phrase has been more often quoted in behalf of papal
inerrancy than that in which, referring to the Pelagian
controversy, he says:--

/#
"Already on this matter two Councils have sent to
the Apostolic See, whence also answers have been
received. The cause is finished, would that the error
were also finished."[1]
#/

In other words, says a Roman writer,[2] Pope Innocent I.
has determined the matter. The Pontifical Decree has
settled that the truth is on Augustine's side. Could
it do so unless it were infallible? To another writer
this inference is indisputably clear.[3]

It is, however, more than questionable whether this
exposition would satisfy Roman critical writers of to-day.
For they do not claim Pope Innocent's reply to
the African Bishops as an exercise of Infallibility. Thus
Augustine's criticism is no evidence of his belief in
Innocent's inerrancy.

/#
"St Augustine and all his century," says a Bishop
of the Roman Church, "like the centuries before him,
placed the supreme authority, the authority which cannot
fail, not in the Pope alone, but in the Pope and the
Episcopate."[4]
#/

Nevertheless, the passage was appealed to by the
Ultramontanes in the Vatican struggle. They assigned
to St Augustine the statement: "Rome has spoken,
the cause is finished." This was the form in which
Augustine's sentiments were commonly quoted for
centuries. Gratry's criticism upon it represents the
opposition.

[Footnote 1: St Aug. Serm. cxxii. Gaume, v. 930[**P2: .]]

[Footnote 2: Botalla, i. p. 77.]

[Footnote 3: Perrone, p. 43.]

[Footnote 4: Maret, i. p. 161.]
-----File: p020.png--------------------------------------------------------

/#
"Rome has spoken, the cause is finished. It is
certain that this formula of St Augustine possesses
something decisive and absolute about it like an axiom.
It says everything. 'Rome has spoken, the cause is
finished.' Rome has spoken; all is said, the rest is of
no consequence.

"But the objection to this is that St Augustine never
said that at all."
#/

Gratry then quotes the passage as it actually occurs.
To Gratry's mind the real words do not even imply that
the judgment of Rome by itself is everything; while the
misquoted formula does.[1]

<tb>

4. Constantly appealed to again are the words of St
Jerome.

/#
"I know that the Roman faith praised by the Apostle's
voice does not accept suggestion of such a kind.
Although an angel taught otherwise than that which
has been once proclaimed, strengthened by the authority
of St Paul, it could not change."[2]
#/

/#
"Upon this rock I know that the Church is builded.
I entreat you, authorise me by your letters either to
assert or not to assert three substances. I shall not
fear to assert three substances if you order me."[3]
#/

Here, then, St Jerome is found affirming that the
Roman Church cannot fail, and that he who accepts
its instruction cannot be misguided.[4]

On the other hand, Bishop Bossuet appeals to
Jerome's own account of Pope Liberius that he was
induced to endorse heresy, and that, overcome by the
weariness of exile, he subscribed to heretical error.[5]

[Footnote 1: Second letter.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ad Rufinum</i>, ii.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Ep. ad Damasum</i>, ii. p. 131.]

[Footnote 4: Perrone, p. 42.]

[Footnote 5: Bossuet, xxii. p. 227. Jerome, <i>De Script. Eccles. and Chronicon</i>.]
-----File: p021.png--------------------------------------------------------
The question, therefore, arises whether Jerome would
not have feared to follow an example which he so
describes. Can he who so describes Liberius have
believed that he who accepts papal instruction cannot
be misguided?

<tb>

5. Another example is the striking utterance of Pope
Gelasius.

/#
"This it is against which the Apostolic See is greatly
on its guard, that the glorious confession of the Apostle,
since it is the security of the world, should not be defiled
by the least error or contagion.[1] For if--which God
avert, and we trust cannot happen--such a misfortune
should occur, how could we venture to resist any error,
or how should we be able to correct the wandering?"
#/

Gelasius teaches here, said Bellarmine, that the
Apostolic See cannot err. For since the security of the
world depends upon its utterances, if it were to err the
whole world would be in error with it.[2]

Bossuet, on the other hand, replied as follows: A
Roman Synod addressed to Bishops the question: How
could they correct the error of the people if they were
in error themselves? This was not an encouragement
to think themselves infallible, but a warning to take
precautions against being deceived. Similarly Gelasius
claims that consciousness of the disastrous results which
would attend its deception has deepened the cautiousness
of the Roman See. To infer, however, from the
character of the results, the impossibility of the occurrence
is, says Bossuet, the utterly illogical conclusion
that what ought not will not be. The dangerous
character of the results which would follow from deception
of the Roman See do not prove the impossibility of
its occurrence. All they prove is the urgent necessity

[Footnote 1: Bossuet, xxii. p. 277.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Works</i>, ii. p. 83.]
-----File: p022.png--------------------------------------------------------
for care and deliberation. And this is what Gelasius
implies. For his language is--"which God avert, we
trust it cannot happen." But this is the language of
prayer and piety; it is not the certainty of a truth
revealed. Gelasius has every hope that, contingently
on compliance with the necessary conditions, this
disaster will not be permitted to take place. But we
may not transpose hope into fact. Tested by history,
urges Bossuet, individual occupants of the Roman See
have grievously misled the Church. Liberius and
Honorius, as far as in them lay, did actually deceive
the world. Yet the world was not deceived: for other
remedies exist against calamities such as these. The
language of Gelasius is one of the most magnificent
from the Roman See. But it is the language of a
pious confidence, not a dogma of the immutable faith.

<tb>

6. The classic expression of the proper method, according
to the Ancient Church, for distinguishing Catholic
Faith from falsehood, is the famous Canon of St Vincent
of Lerins. We propose to summarise his principles, and
then to record their controversial use within the Roman
Communion.

/#
"Moreover, in the Catholic Church itself all possible
care must be taken that we hold that faith which has
been believed everywhere always by all. For that is
truly and in the strictest sense Catholic, which, as the
name itself and the reason of the thing declare, comprehends
all universally.

"This rule we shall observe if we follow universality,
antiquity, consent. We shall follow universality if we
confess that one faith to be true, which the whole Church
throughout the world confesses; antiquity, if we in no
wise depart from those interpretations which it is
manifest were notoriously held by our holy ancestors
and fathers; consent, in like manner, if in antiquity
#/
-----File: p023.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
itself we adhere to the consentient definitions and
determinations of all, or at least of almost all priests
and doctors."[1]
#/

Vincent's famous Canon states the appeal to tradition
in a triple form: in relation to place and time and
persons. The test of a doctrine's apostolic character
is its universality in place and time. That which commands
a consent virtually coextensive with the Church's
existence, across the entire world geographically, and
across the entire Christian ages historically, constitutes
the Catholic Faith.

Vincent's application of this test to several instances
shows alike its clearness and its use.

/#
i. First Case--If the Local oppose the Universal.[**thought break above instead?]
#/

"What, then, will a Catholic Christian do if a small
portion of the Church have cut itself off from the
communion of the universal faith?

"What, surely, but prefer the soundness of the whole
body to the unsoundness of a pestilent and corrupt
member?"

/#
ii. Second Case--If the Modern oppose the Ancient.
#/

"What if some novel contagion seek to infect not merely
an insignificant portion of the Church, but the whole?

"Then it will be his care to cleave to antiquity,
which at this day cannot possibly be seduced by any
fraud of novelty.

"To preach any doctrine therefore to Catholic
Christians other than what they have received never
was lawful, never is lawful, never will be lawful."

Thus according to Vincent the Christian obligation
is to keep that deposit of doctrine which is committed
to our trust. And this obligation rests in general on

[Footnote 1: <i>Commonitorium</i>, ii.]
-----File: p024.png--------------------------------------------------------
the Universal Church, and in particular on the whole
body of pastors whose duty it is to possess and communicate
to others a complete knowledge of religion.
Vincent considers the transmission of the Faith in its
integrity the function not exclusively of the pastors,
but also of the entire community of the Universal
Church. His famous often quoted words must be
quoted once again, for it would be impossible to express
his theory in better terms than his own.

/#
"Keep the Deposit. What is the Deposit? That
which has been entrusted to thee, not that which thou
hast thyself devised: a matter not of wit but of learning;
not of private adoption but of public tradition; a matter
brought to thee, not put forth by thee, wherein thou
art bound to be not an author but a keeper, not a
teacher but a disciple, not a leader but a follower....
Let that which formerly was believed, though imperfectly
apprehended, as expounded by thee be clearly
understood. Let posterity welcome, understood through
thy exposition, what antiquity venerated without understanding.
Yet teach still the same truths which thou
hast learned, so that while thou speakest newly, thou
speakest not what is new."
#/

Nothing can be stronger than St Vincent's sense
of the substantial immutability of the Faith. Nor is
there any finer exposition than his of the principle
of identity. What is perhaps even more remarkable,
considering the period when he wrote, is his recognition
that the principle of immutability requires to be balanced
by the principle of progress. We have in his pages
the earliest statement of the principles of theological
development, drawn with a wonderful insight into its
nature and limitations.

"But some one will say, perhaps--Shall there then be no
<i>progress</i> in the Christian Church? Certainly all possible
progress.... Yet on condition that it be real progress,
-----File: p025.png--------------------------------------------------------
<i>not alteration</i> of the Faith. For progress requires that
the subject be enlarged in itself, alteration that it
be <i>transformed into something else</i>. The intelligence,
then, the knowledge, the wisdom, as well of individual
as of all, as well of <i>one man</i> as of <i>the whole Church</i>,
ought in the course of ages and centuries, to increase
and make much and vigorous progress; <i>but yet only in
its own kind</i>; <i>i.e</i>., in the same doctrine, in the same
sense, and in the same meaning."

Thus, according to Vincent, there may be all possible
progress consistent with substantial identity. And the
method by which the progress of the Church of the
present day is safeguarded and controlled is perpetual
reversion to the primitive type; any substantial
deviation from which is a sign of variation from the
truth.

The Romanist opponent of Papal Infallibility laid
the greatest stress on St Vincent's principle, while the
Ultramontane attempted a distinction between implicit
and explicit truth. Grant that the Catholic faith must
be contained in the original deposit of Revelation, must
its recognition have been explicit from the first?[1] The
Canon of St Vincent was asserted to be true in an
affirmative sense, but not in a negative. Whatever
satisfies the test of universality was undoubtedly part of
the Catholic faith; but it did not follow that a doctrine
which failed to fulfil this test was therefore uncatholic.

This distinction carried no conviction to a very large
minority in the Roman Church, partly because the
doctrine in question did not satisfy the test of universality,
even in the nineteenth century, and partly
because of the doctrine's intrinsic character. They failed
to see how a doctrine which explicitly affirmed the
Pope's independence of the Church's consent could be

[Footnote 1: <i>Franzelin. De Trad.</i> p. 295.]
-----File: p026.png--------------------------------------------------------
a legitimate outcome of, and implicitly contained within,
the principle of consent, which is the negative of that
independence. Vincent placed the whole stress on
universality and consent. The Ultramontane considered
the Pope's utterance infallible without that universality
and consent. To the Roman opponents of the Vatican
view these two theories seemed mutually exclusive.
They could not reconcile the Vincentian Canon with
the Vatican claim, nor reject St Vincent's demand that
progress must retain substantial identity. They remembered
how Bishop Bossuet, intellectually the head
of the seventeenth-century Church in France, had
claimed for the Roman Catholic Church the distinctive
glory of immutability--the <i>quod semper</i> of St Vincent--as
contrasted with the variations of Protestantism.[1]

In the Vatican Council itself the Bishops appealed
repeatedly to the Canon of St Vincent as a proof that
the Infallibility doctrine formed no portion of the
Catholic faith. Bishop Maret had already affirmed in
the treatise which he sent to all the members of the
Council that the principles of St Vincent can never
legitimately issue in a system of absolute Infallibility
and monarchy of each individual Pope. Bishop Hefele
said that

/#
"when differences on matters of faith arose in the
primitive Church appeal was made to the Apostolic
Churches, Rome, Alexandria, Antioch; and that only
was dogmatically propounded to the faithful, which
was universally believed. None of the ancients ever
imagined that an infallible decision of controversies
could be obtained by any shorter method at the hands
of any single individual. On the contrary, Vincent
said, let us follow universality, antiquity, consent."[2]
#/

[Footnote 1: Bossuet, <i>Premier Avertisement aux Protestants</i>.]

[Footnote 2: Friedrich, <i>Documenta</i>, ii. p. 121.]
-----File: p027.png--------------------------------------------------------

Another Bishop urged that according to the principle
of St Vincent no definition could be made without
moral unanimity. We have no proof, said another
Bishop, least of all from the first five centuries. And
if nothing can ever be defined except that which has
been believed always everywhere and by all, by what
right can we defend the Papal Infallibility? None but
the Bishops, said another, can testify whether a doctrine
is held always everywhere and by all. Consequently,
he, and others with him, demurred to the opinion
that a Pope's utterance could be infallible without the
consent of the episcopate.

More emphatic still was the statement of the
American Archbishop Kenrick:--

/#
"The famous writer, Vincent of Lerins, in his golden
treatise the <i>Commonitorium</i>, which has been highly
esteemed for the last fourteen centuries ... gives the
rule by which a believer should guide himself when
conflicting opinions arise among the Bishops: namely,
that nothing is to be considered of Catholic faith
which has not been acknowledged always everywhere
and by all. When the Bishops disagree Vincent affirms
that antiquity and universality are to be followed.
He makes no reference to the Roman Pontiff whose
opinion, according to the Pontifical Party, instantly
determines all controversies of faith. This theory
assuredly Vincent never heard of. And his contemporaries
entirely agreed with him."
#/

The authors of Janus made an equally strong appeal
to St Vincent of Lerins.

/#
"If the view of Roman Infallibility had existed anywhere
in the Church at that time, it could not have been
possibly passed over in a book exclusively concerned
with the question of the means for ascertaining the
#/
-----File: p028.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
genuine Christian doctrine. But the author keeps to
the three notes of universality, permanence, and consent,
and to the Ecumenical Councils."[1]
#/

7. What was the true relation of the Pope and the
Council to each other? How was it understood in
primitive times? Did the Collective Episcopate regard
itself as subordinated, with no independent judgment
of its own, to decisions of the Roman authority? Or
was the Council conscious of possessing power to accept
or refuse the papal utterances brought before it?[2]
Bossuet maintained that the treatment of Papal Letters
by the early General Councils afforded convincing
proof against their belief in any theory of papal
inerrancy. The famous letter of Leo to Flavian was
laid before the Council of Chalcedon in the following
terms:--"Let the Bishops say whether the teaching of
the 318 Fathers [the Council of Nicea] or that of the
150 [Constantinople] agrees with the letter of Leo." Nor
was Leo's letter accepted until its agreement with the
standards of the former Ecumenical Councils had been
ascertained.

The very signatures of the subscribing Bishops bear
this out--"The letter of Leo agrees," says one, "with
the Creed of the 318 Fathers and of the 150 Fathers,
and with the decisions at Ephesus under St Cyril.
Wherefore I assent and willingly subscribe."[3] Thus
the act of the Episcopate at Chalcedon was one of
critical investigation and authoritative judgment, not of
blind submission to an infallible voice. The theologian,
Bellarmine, and the historian, Baronius, both strong
advocates of the papal authority, contradict one another
on this point. Baronius asserts that the Bishops regarded
the letter of Leo as the rule and guide in faith which

[Footnote 1: Janus, p. 89[** .]]

[Footnote 2: Bossuet, <i>Defence</i>, i. p. 80.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Ibid.</i> ii. p. 38.]
-----File: p029.png--------------------------------------------------------
all churches must accept. Bellarmine, however, perplexed
by the episcopal investigation which undeniably
the letter endured, suggested that Leo's letter to the
Council was not intended as a final definition, but as a
general advice for the Bishops' assistance.

Bossuet points out that this happy solution is refuted
by the simple fact that Leo wrote to Flavian before any
Council was even thought of.[1] It illustrates Bellarmine's
uncritical ingenuity. And since Baronius acknowledges
the authoritative character of Leo's letter, and Bellarmine
the reality of its scrutiny by the Bishops, the obvious
conclusion is that both the papal authority and the
consent of the Universal Council are elements in
producing a dogma of the Faith. Accordingly, the
Pope's decision, taken by itself apart from the consent
of the Church, is not infallible. Bossuet claims that
Leo's own teaching endorses this, for he wrote the
following words: "The things which God had formerly
defined by our ministry, He confirmed by the irreversible
consent of the entire brotherhood."

To sum up the procedure of the early Church in a
question of faith: Bishop Flavian first declared what was
of faith as the local Bishop. Leo at Rome endorsed it
and gave his definition. After this definition came the
examination of the question in the General Council,
and judgment was ultimately given. After the definition
had been approved by the judgment of the Bishops
no further room for doubt or dispute remained.[2]

The impression made upon a Roman writer by Roman
research for proof of Infallibility in the writings of the
Fathers may be gathered from the following significant
passage:

/#
"To sum up. The defenders of the dogma of Infallibility
discover valuable hints in history. But they also
#/

[Footnote 1: Bossuet, <i>Defence</i>, i. p. 81.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid</i>. ii. p. 41.]
-----File: p030.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
encounter difficulties. After systematising against the
Gallican School the grounds of their belief, they
endeavoured to meet the difficulties which required
to be solved. These difficulties came from many
sources. They came from Councils which on various
occasions constituted themselves judges of teaching
sent from Rome. They came from certain teachers
who opposed other works to the doctrinal decisions
of Popes. But they came, above all, from Popes themselves
who were not always at the level required of
their mission, and at times allowed themselves to be
ensnared with error."[1]
#/

Primitive evidence for Papal Infallibility is then
admitted by some Roman writers to be meagre and
disappointing.[2] A curious instance of this is found in
the theologian, Melchior Cano. He says that the quotations
given by St Thomas from St Cyril of Alexandria
afford a much clearer evidence for this doctrine than that
in any other patristic writer. But when he sought for the
original passages they were not to be found. "This
is the work of the heretics," he exclaims indignantly.
"They have mutilated the writings, and erased everything
that concerned pontifical authority." So Melchior Cano.
To-day, however, it is universally acknowledged that
these passages were interpolations by which St Thomas
Aquinas was deceived. Thus Melchior Cano's clearest
evidence is nothing else than a simple forgery.

CHAPTER III

THE CASE OF HONORIUS


The case of Pope Honorius naturally occupied the
attention of Roman Catholics more than any other
instance of papal pronouncements, because it presented
peculiar difficulties to the advocates of Infallibility. The
literature created by this single case within the Roman
Communion is enormous. We shall but represent its
actual historical position in the development of the
subject, if we treat it at considerable and even disproportionate
length. For in reality it is no solitary
incident. It reaches out into the Universal Councils
of the Church. It shows the early conception of the
relation between Council and Pope; what the Collective
Episcopate thought of the nature of a papal definition
of faith; what subsequent Popes thought of a predecessor's
pronouncement.

To understand it we must revert to the conditions of
Christian thought when the first four General Councils
were completed. The Incarnation was then interpreted
to involve two natures united in one Person. But the
inferences which this statement required were not yet
clearly thought out. The difficulty of the period was
to allow full scope to the human nature in Christ. If
there was one Person in Christ, then there must be
one will, and that will manifestly divine. Accordingly
it was supposed that His human nature had no human
-----File: p032.png--------------------------------------------------------
will. The relation of the divine to the human in Christ
was thought to resemble that of the soul to the body,
in such a way that the human nature was but a will-less
passive instrument under the absolute control of the
will which was divine.

This is the Monothelite heresy. It is a heresy of a
disastrous kind, for it virtually denies the reality of
the Incarnation. If the Son of God took a will-less
human nature, then He did not take our human nature
at all. For the will is essential to the perfection of
our nature.

Now the Monothelite heresy was widely prevalent in
the East: the real leader and chief promoter being
Sergius, Patriarch of Constantinople. Acting under his
influence, Cyrus, Patriarch of Alexandria, published in
633 a document asserting the existence of only one will
in Christ. This was earnestly opposed by Sophronius,
afterwards Patriarch of Jerusalem, who entreated Cyrus
to cancel the objectionable statement, and visited Sergius
with a view to enlist his support. This he naturally
failed to obtain. But Sergius, with more subtlety than
frankness, being in fact alarmed at the sensation produced
by the heresy in Catholic minds, proposed as a compromise
that both the assertion of one energy in Christ,
and the counter-assertion of two energies should be
abandoned. Sophronius consented. Sergius then wrote
his famous diplomatic letter to Honorius of Rome,
giving his own version of the controversy, explaining
that in the interests of peace it was desirable that
both expressions should be discouraged. To speak of
"one energy" in Christ seemed strange to many, and
offended them because it seemed to deny the duality
of nature in our Lord; while the expression "two
energies" offended others, because it would follow that
there were two contradictory wills in Christ. Sergius
-----File: p033.png--------------------------------------------------------
then explained his theory by the illustration that as
the body is controlled by the soul, so is the human
nature in Christ controlled by His Divine Will--an
illustration which certainly ought to have opened
Honorius's eyes, even if the proposal to abandon the
orthodox expression, "two energies," did not already
alarm him. Now this letter of Sergius was condemned
by the Sixth General Council. But this same letter
Honorius approved.

Honorius replied that he learns from Sergius's letter
that new controversies have been stirred up by a certain
Sophronius, a monk, now Bishop of Jerusalem, against
"our brother, Cyrus of Alexandria, who taught converts
from heresy the doctrine of one energy in Christ." He is
glad to hear that this expression, "one energy," has been
abandoned, because it "might give offence to the simple."
Honorius, however, asserts for himself "we confess one
will of our Lord Jesus Christ," and explains that
there was no diverse or conflicting will in the human
nature of Christ; no conflict that is of the flesh against
the spirit. He says that we may not erect into dogmas
of the Church the statements that in Christ there is one
energy or two, since neither the New Testament nor
the Councils have so taught. He says, further, that he
desires to reject everything which as a novelty of
expression might cause uneasiness in the Church. He
is quite aware that the expression "two energies" might
be considered Nestorian, and "one energy" Eutychian.
Accordingly, he "exhorts" Sergius to avoid both expressions
and to keep to the already sanctioned phrases.

This letter of Honorius was utilised in the East to
justify the Monothelite heresy--the existence of one
will in Christ. Honorius died shortly after its publication
(638). His successor, John IV., defended Honorius's
orthodoxy on the ground that, since Sergius's enquiry
-----File: p034.png--------------------------------------------------------
was concerned only with our Lord's humanity, the reply
was similarly restricted to the same. A later successor,
Martin I., held a Synod at the Lateran in 649, in which
the two Patriarchs, Cyrus of Alexandria and Sergius of
Constantinople, were both condemned as Monothelites;
and in which, without any allusion to Honorius, it
was affirmed that the coexistence of two wills in
Christ was a necessary consequence of the co-existence[**P3: coexistence above]
of the two natures, human and divine. In 680 was held
the Sixth General Council with a view to reconcile and
reunite the East with the West. To this Council Pope
Agatho sent a letter reaffirming the orthodox doctrine of
two natural wills and operations, and declaring that
his Church had, by the grace of God, never erred from
the Apostolic Tradition nor submitted to heretical
innovations. This letter the Council received and
adopted; and proceeded to condemn as heretical the
writings of his predecessor, Honorius, upon whom they
gave judgment as well as upon the two Patriarchs
of Alexandria and Constantinople. After reading the
letter of Sergius to Pope Honorius and that of
Honorius to Sergius, the Council pronounced judgment
in the following terms:--

/#
"We find that these documents are quite foreign to the
Apostolic dogmas, also to the declarations of the holy
Councils, and all the Fathers of repute; therefore we
entirely reject them, and execrate them as hurtful to
the soul. But the names of these men must also be
thrust forth from the Church, namely, that of Sergius,
who first wrote on this impious doctrine; further, that
of Cyrus of Alexandria, etc.... We anathematise them
all. And along with them, it is our unanimous decree that
there shall be expelled from the Church and anathematised
Honorius, formerly Pope of Old Rome, because we
found in his letter to Sergius that in all respects he
followed his view and confirmed his impious doctrines."
#/
-----File: p035.png--------------------------------------------------------

This conclusion was followed up by burning the
heretical letters, including that of Pope Honorius. It
is significant that when the Council were about to
proceed to pronounce the Anathemas, George, Patriarch
of Constantinople, was anxious to secure the omission
of his predecessors' name, but the majority overruled
him. So the sentence was uttered, "Anathema to the
heretic Sergius, to the heretic Cyrus, to the heretic
Honorius."

The announcement of these decisions was made not
to Pope Agatho, for he had died; but to his successor,
Leo II. Leo accepted the decisions of Constantinople.
He has carefully examined the Acts of the Council
and found them in harmony with the declarations of
faith of his predecessor, Agatho, and of the Synod
of the Lateran. He anathematised all these heretics,
including his predecessor, Honorius, "who so far
from aiding the Apostolic See with the doctrine of the
Apostolic Tradition, attempted to subvert the faith by
a profane betrayal."

This condemnation of Honorius was reiterated by
two more Ecumenical Councils. It recurs in the papal
Profession of Faith uttered by each Pope on his accession
down to the eleventh century. This formula is contained
in the <i>Liber Diurnus</i>, a volume which has had a
remarkable history. The <i>Liber Diurnus</i> is a collection
of ancient documents relating to the Papal Office, forms
of faith, and other formulas, which were in use in the
Roman Church probably from the sixth to the eleventh
centuries. The collection was made in Rome itself.
At what precise date the formulas therein contained
ceased to be in use the learned appear unable to
say.

The <i>Liber Diurnus</i> disappeared from sight and almost
from memory. Its very existence seemed uncertain.

In the middle of the seventeenth century Holstein,
afterwards librarian of the Vatican, found the MS. at
Rome.[1] Another MS. was found in the Jesuit College
of Clermont in Paris. Holstein prepared an edition
for the press. It should have seen the light in 1650.[2]
Nothing was wanting but approval of the censors.
The approval was, however, refused, and the copies were
consigned to imprisonment in the Vatican. The reason
for this suppression is given by the liturgical writer,
Cardinal Bona:[3]--

/#
"Since in the Profession of Faith by the Pope elect,
P. Honorius is condemned as having given encouragement
to the depraved assertions of heretics--if these
words actually occur in the original and there is no
obvious means of remedying such a wound--it is
better that the work should not be published--<i>præstat
non divulgari opus</i>."[4]
#/

Such was Cardinal Bona's opinion and advice.

Another learned writer, P. Sirmond, in a letter to
Holstein, expressed himself with still more remarkable
frankness:--

/#
"It appears to me not so astonishing," said Sirmond,
"that the Greek Monothelites should attempt to identify
Honorius with their error, as it seems extraordinary
that the Romans themselves, in the newly elected Pope's
Profession of Faith, should have branded the name of
Honorius together with the authors of heretical ideas,
such as Sergius, etc., for having given encouragement
to the depraved assertions of heretics. And yet such
are the terms of that Profession of Faith, as I found it
among the ancient formulas of the Roman Church.
And this is the only reason which deterred me from

producing an edition of it, notwithstanding my promise
to Cardinal S."[1]
#/

The suppression of Holstein's edition created a
sensation among the learned men of France. "The
<i>Liber Diurnus</i>," wrote Launoy, "has been printed in
Rome several years, and is detained by the masters
of the Papal Court and the Inquisitors. These men
cannot bear the light of ancient truth."[2] However, in
the year 1680, the Jesuit writer, Garnier, published an
edition of the work. Whatever his motive may have
been and it is still disputed, he was summoned to
Rome to give an explanation, and died on the way.[3]
However, the mischief was out, and from that time
authorised publication became easy. The great scholar,
Mabillon, printed the work without let or hindrance, and
the comparative indifference of the world exemplified
the maxim that an institution which has survived a
fact will also survive its publication.

Such, then, appear to be the historic facts, stated as
objectively as we can state them.

We now proceed to give the various Roman explanations.
"It is," says Hefele,[4] the learned historian of the
Councils, "in the highest degree startling, even scarcely
credible, that an Ecumenical Council should punish
with anathemas a Pope as a heretic." Certainly from
an Ultramontane standpoint it must be so. And this
perplexity has led to a curious and instructive variety
of conflicting solutions from the days of Cardinal
Bellarmine down to the present time.

1. First explanation: It was boldly asserted in the
seventeenth century that Pope Honorius was not condemned
at all. The historian, Baronius, made himself

[Footnote 1: Rosière, cxiv.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid</i>. xlix. lvii.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Ibid</i>. lx. lxi.]

[Footnote 4: <i>History of the Councils</i>, i. p. 181. (Engl. trans.).]
-----File: p038.png--------------------------------------------------------
responsible for this view, and Bellarmine followed him.
No doubt the documents as we possess them affirm the
contrary; but then they must have been interpolated
and falsified. The reasons given for this procedure are
that the Council of the Lateran over which Pope Martin
presided condemned the Monothelites, but did not
mention Honorius. Also that the Ecumenical Council
of Constantinople could not possibly have condemned
Honorius as a heretic; for that would make them
contradict Pope Agatho's letter, to the effect that the
Apostolic Church had never strayed from the path of the
Apostolic Tradition, nor yielded to the perversions of
heretical novelties. Either, therefore, the Council's words
are falsified, or the letter of Agatho is falsified, or the
Council and Agatho disagree. But no one asserts this
last, and no one has ever suggested the second, therefore
the first alternative is the one to be maintained.
Bellarmine shows grounds to mistrust those fraudulent
Greeks. He gives numerous instances of forgery.
Baronius conjectures that a heretical Bishop, finding
his own name in the Council's list of the condemned,
quietly erased it and substituted that of Pope Honorius.

Bossuet[1] thinks the mere recital of these conjectures
sufficient refutation, and deplores that so learned a man
should be dishonoured by these fictions. Sceptical
criticism so utterly unfounded would, if universally
applied, destroy the foundation of all historic certainty.

A recent Roman writer (1906) says that the theory of
Bellarmine and Baronius offers valuable advantage, that
is to the Ultramontane, but is attended by enormous
difficulties.[2] For, if the fraudulent Greeks interpolated
the Acts of the Council, who interpolated the letter of
Leo II. in which he accepts its conclusion and condemns

[Footnote 1: <i>Works</i>, V. xvii. p. 67.]

[Footnote 2: Turmel, <i>Hist. Théol. Positive</i>, p. 315.]
-----File: p039.png--------------------------------------------------------
Honorius by name? Accordingly the solution dear to
Bellarmine and Baronius has been abandoned by the
strongest advocates of Papal Infallibility.

2. A second explanation admitted that Honorius was
condemned, but asserted that he was only condemned in
his private capacity, as an individual theologian, and not
as Pope.

One obvious advantage of this theory was that at any
rate it did no violence to historic documents. It
encouraged no universal scepticism as to sources.
Bellarmine himself suggested it as an alternative to
those who could not be satisfied with discrediting wholesale
on suspicion the long series of documents. But
Bellarmine did not like the theory; for he held that
although the opinion that a Pope can err as a private
teacher is probable, yet the opposite opinion was more
probable still. However, for those whom it might assist,
there it was. All that the Council meant to say was
that Honorius by his private letters promoted heresy.

Private letters! echoes Bossuet[1] scornfully. When,
then, is a decision given, <i>ex cathedra</i>, unless when
the successor of St Peter, being consulted by the entire
East, should suppress a deadly error and strengthen his
brethren? Or did he prefer to be deceived, when, being
so interrogated, he did not reply under these conditions
in which he knew that he could not be deceived?

A recent Roman writer[2] assures us that the opinion
that the letter of Honorius was compiled as a private
theologian has never been enthusiastically received,
never achieved a real success. Its partisans have been
few in number and authority.

with heresy even as a private doctor was too much for

/#
the infallibilists. On the other hand, the Gallicans
could not forget Bossuet's retort. 'When can a Pope
have cause to speak <i>ex cathedra</i> if not when consulted
by the entire East?'"[1]
#/

3. A third explanation of the case of Honorius is
that he was condemned for heresy, but mistakenly;
the Council being in error on a question of fact.
Bellarmine proposes this as an alternative solution to
those who cannot be induced to believe that the Decrees
of the Sixth General Council have been interpolated
and corrupted. It may be said that Honorius was
actually condemned by the Council as a heretic, but
that they acted on false information. If infallible in
doctrine, they were not infallible in questions of fact.
If the reader objects, and interposes an enquiry whether
Bellarmine understands Honorius's letter better than
an Ecumenical Council understood him, the ready reply
is that Pope Agatho said that his See had never
strayed. Pope Agatho understood the letter of Honorius
better than the Greeks assembled in the Council. If
you ask why, then, didn't the legates of Agatho resist
the condemnation, Bellarmine answers that this was
diplomatic. They acquiesced to avert a greater evil;
namely, continuance of false doctrine. Thus, according
to Bellarmine, to secure the condemnation of the Monothelite
heresy, the legates sanctioned the condemnation
of a Pope for heresy--apparently on the principle of
two evils prefer the less--with consequences, however,
which Bellarmine does not seem to have thought out.
If the reader still persists, in his incredulous temper, to
ask, Why, then, did Pope Leo in his letter after the
Council also condemn Honorius? it is suggested that

[Footnote 1: Turmel, <i>Hist. Théol. Positive</i>, p. 317.]
-----File: p041.png--------------------------------------------------------
you can say that Leo followed the legates of Agatho;
he preferred to let sleeping dogs lie. But we are not
bound, says Bellarmine, to follow Leo. We may follow
Agatho. For you see that whether Honorius erred
is, after all, a question of fact: and in questions of
fact even Popes may differ.

This theory appeared congenial to some in the
sixteenth century. But then it received an unexpected
application, being utilised by the Jansenists to justify
their treatment of papal decisions with respectful
incredulity. Whether certain doctrines were or were
not contained within the pages of Jansenius's great book
was not a question of faith but of fact. Consequently
it was enough to adopt towards any papal assertions
on the subject an attitude of external deference while
maintaining unchanged one's inward convictions.

This application opened the eyes of papal theologians
to the dangerous character of the theory. It became,
says Turmel,[1] almost invariably abandoned among
defenders of Papal Infallibility.

But, after all, was the Universal Council mistaken
in the interpretation it placed upon the theological
contents of Honorius's letter? Upon this question
Roman writers have been sharply divided. This was
the defence set up for him by his immediate successor,
but obviously not accepted by the long line of his
successors who condemned him; nor by the Ecumenical
Council which pronounced its judgment upon him;
nor by the two other Ecumenical Councils which
followed.

Honorius's successor, Agatho, indeed asserted that
his See had never deflected from the way of truth, and
that the Roman Pontiffs had obeyed the injunction laid
upon Peter to strengthen his brethren. This language

[Footnote 1: Turmel, <i>Hist. Théol. Positive</i>, p. 32.]
-----File: p042.png--------------------------------------------------------
was accepted by the Fathers of the Sixth Council.
But what they understood by it, said Bossuet, can
be readily gathered from the following single fact:
they approved the teaching of Agatho, but they
condemned the teaching of Honorius. Manifestly they
did not endorse the theory that no Roman Pontiff
had ever deflected from the faith, or that his decisions
deserved the unquestioning submission of Christendom.
All that the Council could have assented to was that
as a general fact the truth was held in Rome; without
pronouncing any opinion as to the invariable fidelity
of individual Popes. If Agatho meant more than
this, he was, said Bossuet, mistaken in a question of
fact. His statement must be set beside that of Leo II.,
who affirmed that Honorius, "instead of suppressing
the flame of heretical views by his apostolic authority,
encouraged it by his neglect."

The immediate successors of Honorius passed over
his error and spared his memory. This was natural.
For his pontificate was exemplary in other respects;
he died in the peace of the Church; he had not acted
with evil intentions; nor was he pertinacious in defence
of his error; nor did anything in the condition of the
Western Church require a public refutation of his error.
But in the East it was otherwise. The Monothelites
publicly supported themselves under his authority.
Accordingly, the Sixth Council felt compelled to condemn
Honorius also, as having in all things followed the
lines of Sergius and promoted his dangerous teaching.
Thus the Council's reply to Agatho's letter on the
invariability of his See was an announcement that
they had condemned his predecessor.

Bellarmine boldly asserts that in any case Honorius's
letters contain no heresy. He only forbade the use of
the terms, "one will," or "two wills" in Christ, a course
-----File: p043.png--------------------------------------------------------
which, according to the same writer, only shows his
prudence. The critical words, "Wherefore we confess
one will in our Lord Jesus Christ," are, as his explanation
shows, a reference exclusively to Christ's human
nature. What he meant was that in Christ as man
there were not two conflicting wills of the flesh and
the spirit.

Bossuet replied that probably Honorius was not
heretical in his private convictions. But he very badly
instructed the Patriarchs who consulted him; and he
secured peace at the price of silence as to the Orthodox
Faith. He spoke disparagingly of the teaching of
Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, who maintained
the Catholic Truth upon the subject, and favourably
of Cyrus of Alexandria, who propagated the false
doctrine. His language suggests heretical explanation.
It was most unsuited to the special occasion
and the requirements of the Church. It failed to
give any definite guidance on the doctrine in question;
and, by its vague and general terms, promoted the
very error which ought to have been suppressed.

Perhaps the ablest Roman criticism on the contents
of Honorius's letter is that of the historian Hefele. It
should be read in the form in which he published it
prior to the alterations which the Vatican Council
forced upon his historical expositions. "Honorius,"
says Hefele,[1] "did not grasp the matter aright at the
very beginning." He argued briefly but inappropriately
that where there is one Person there is only one Worker
and therefore only one Will. He said that in our
ordinary corrupted nature there are certainly two
wills, that of the flesh and that of the spirit, but that
the former is only a consequence of the Fall, and
therefore could not exist in Christ. "So far Honorius

[Footnote 1: <i>History of the Councils</i>, p. 32.]
-----File: p044.png--------------------------------------------------------
was quite on the right way; but he did not accurately
draw the inferences." He ought now to have said:
Hence it follows that in Christ, since He is God and
man, there exists, together with His Divine Will, only
the incorrupt human will. But Honorius kept the
human will entirely out of account. He thought that
to maintain the co-existence of two distinct wills in
Christ would compel the admission of two contradictory
wills. He ought to have answered Sergius, You are
quite right in saying we must not ascribe two contrary
wills to Christ; but, nevertheless, there are in Christ
two wills, the divine and the incorrupt human.[1] Instead
of which Honorius asserted: "We confess one will of
our Lord Jesus Christ." Hefele, even after the Vatican
decision, felt constrained to describe this statement as
"the unhappy sentence which, literally taken, is quite
Monothelite."[2]

Hefele also was unable to accept the excuse for this
language, proposed by Honorius's immediate successor,
to the effect that, being consulted only on the man-*hood
of Christ, there was no occasion to speak of
anything else than the human will. This interpretation
Hefele characterises as <i>suavior quam verior</i>. For it
is simply untrue that he was consulted only on the
contents of Christ's human will. Sergius did not ask
whether we ought to acknowledge in Christ a will
of the flesh and a will of the spirit. He asked nothing
at all on this subject, but asserted that in Christ there
can be only one will. Hefele's conclusion accordingly
was that Honorius encouraged heresy by enjoining
silence on the orthodox expression, "two energies," and
still more by the unhappy expression, "We confess one
will in our Lord Jesus Christ."[3]

But even then, Hefele is constrained by his historic

[Footnote 1: <i>History of the Councils</i>, p. 36.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 54.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 58.]
-----File: p045.png--------------------------------------------------------
insight to recognise that the Sixth Ecumenical Council
thought much more seriously of Honorius's errors than
Hefele himself does; especially as controlled by the
Vatican Council. After recalling the association of
Honorius with Sergius and others, and the exact
language of the condemnation, Hefele says:--

/#
"From all this it cannot be doubtful in what sense
Pope Honorius was anathematised by the Sixth Ecumenical
Council, and it is equally beyond doubt that
the Council judged much more severely respecting
him than we have done."[1]
#/

Into the significance of this difference of judgment
Hefele does not enter. But apart from all enquiry
whether the estimate of an Ecumenical Council outweighs
that of an individual theologian, apart from the question
of the accuracy of their decision, there lie the theological
principles which this severity of judgment on a papal
utterance involved. Such condemnation obviously
assumes a certain conception of the value and authority
of papal decisions. Hefele said that "It is in the
highest degree startling, even scarcely credible, that an
Ecumenical Council should punish with anathema a
Pope as a heretic." And on Ultramontane presuppositions
so it is. Does not this, together with the evident
difficulty which a modern Romanist experiences in
bringing himself to accept this Ecumenical decision,
betray a singular deviation from the principles of an
earlier age? That which seems to-day "in the highest
degree startling, even scarcely credible," did it appear
in that light to the age in which it was decreed? Did
the startled representatives of the Apostles shrink away
in silent amazement at their own audacity, abashed

[Footnote 1: <i>History of the Councils</i>, p. 184.]
-----File: p046.png--------------------------------------------------------
before the horror of the Catholic world? Or did not
the Pope of the period assent to their decrees as being
in no way conflicting with Catholic principles?

4. A fourth explanation of the fact has been proposed.
It is acknowledged that Honorius was condemned, but
asserted that he was not charged with heresy, but
only with imprudence.

This was the theory of Father Garnier, the Jesuit,
editor of the <i>Liber Diurnus</i>. An admirable summary
of his opinions is given by Turmel in his <i>Histoire de
la Théologie Positive</i>.[1]

Garnier read the Council's sentence that Honorius
"followed the false doctrines of the heretics." This
means, says Garnier, that he failed in courage to oppose
them. If Honorius was declared excommunicated and
anathematised, this only meant that he had made himself
congenial to heretics by imposing silence on certain
expressions, not that he had sanctioned heretical ideas.
If the Council ordered his letters to be burnt, as tending
to the same impiety as those of Sergius, this did not
mean that they were necessarily heretical. A writing
may tend to impiety by its omissions just as much
as by its positive assertions. Garnier then faced the
great difficulty that the Council proclaimed Anathema
to Sergius and to Honorius.... Anathema to all
heretics. Anathema to all who have taught or teach
one will and one energy in our Lord Jesus Christ.
Surely, this time, Honorius is included among the
heretics. Garnier is quite equal to the occasion.
Granted that the Pope was anathematised simultaneously
with the Monothelite, yet it does not follow
that the motive of his condemnation was the same.
Garnier, therefore, says Turmel, closed the Acts of the
Sixth Ecumenical Council with the conviction that

[Footnote 1: Page 317.]
-----File: p047.png--------------------------------------------------------
Honorius was nowhere condemned for heresy, but
simply for his imprudence.

The theory of Garnier, says Turmel, has met with
an approval in the theological world, which has only
increased with the passage of time. It became the
favourite defence of Honorius down to the eve of
the Council of the Vatican.

CHAPTER IV

THE SCHOLASTIC PERIOD


From the case of Honorius we may pass clean away
to <i>the Scholastic period</i>, when the great systematic
theologians were gathering into consolidated form the
developments of the Middle Ages. Six hundred years
have elapsed since Honorius was condemned by the
Episcopate. The relation of Papal to Episcopal power
has greatly changed. To contrast the theology of the
thirteenth century with that of the seventh is to realise
a different atmosphere. Many elements contributed
to the enormous increase of papal influence. The
Mohammedan conquests and the isolation of the
Apostolic Churches of the East left the Roman spirit
to develop its governmental tendencies, unbalanced,
unchecked by those more primitive conceptions which
it was the mission of the unchanging East to retain.
The calamitous severance between the East and West
must have had disastrous influence on the proportionate
development of Papal and Episcopal power.

The growth also of the temporal power of the Roman
See falls within this period. It is neither our purpose
nor permitted by our limits to dwell much on this aspect
of papal claims. Yet a reference to the subject is
necessary, because the growth of temporal power contributed
to the general influences of the Papacy on
the mediæval mind, and to no inconsiderable con-*
-----File: p049.png--------------------------------------------------------
*fusion between the secular and spiritual spheres. The
learned work of Gosselin,[1] Superior of the Seminary
of St Sulpice in 1850, on the power of the Pope in
the Middle Ages, shows how naturally the temporal
authority grew out of the circumstances of the period.

The temporal sovereignty of the Roman See arose
simply out of the necessities of the Roman People,
who, being abandoned by the Empire, intrusted their
temporal interests to the papal guardianship. Neither
Charlemagne nor Pepin were the founders of the
temporal sovereignty; they were but its protectors and
promoters. It was founded in the legitimate consent
of a helpless and forsaken people. But, being once
founded, loftier reasons were gradually created to justify
and explain it. Archbishop Fénelon's opinion, which
Gosselin quotes and accepts, was that the deposition of
princes by the Pope in the Middle Ages was based in the
belief that none but Catholics could rule over Catholic
nations. Consequently, a contract between Prince and
People was implied: their loyalty depending on his
fidelity to Religion. Therefore the Church neither made
temporal rulers nor unmade them; but when consulted
by the people, the Pope decided cases of conscience
arising from a contract and an oath of fidelity. But
this power to determine when consulted, easily slid
into an assertion and a claim of a loftier character.
The double effect of excommunication on the religious
and the temporal status of the victim naturally
led to endless confusion: it exalted the possessor
of this two-fold power to a height which earlier
ages would have considered simply amazing. It
was a principle universally admitted in the time of
Gregory VII. that excommunication entailed the loss
of all civil rights. Consequently, says Fleury, when

[Footnote 1: Translated by Kelly of Maynooth, 2 vs., 1853.]
-----File: p050.png--------------------------------------------------------
Gregory VII., adopting novel maxims, and carrying
them to greater lengths, openly asserted that, as Pope,
he had the right to depose all sovereigns who were
rebellious to the Church, and grounded these pretensions
on the power of excommunication, his opponents had
no defence to make. Conceding the principle that
excommunication involves temporal results, Gregory
was invincible. But the consequence was a vast
extension of the papal authority.

And of course this vastly extended authority affected
the weight of every papal claim. Gosselin's study of
the temporal power of the Papacy is exceedingly
interesting as an illustration of development. It shows
how easily developments may be defended on theological
theories with which those developments had really
nothing whatever to do. Its shows how little we can
trust ultimate developments merely on the ground of
their existence; as if prevalence and legitimacy were
invariably one and the same. It shows the insecurity
of assuming that the theories by which developments
are supported are necessarily the causes by which they
were produced.

The Episcopate still retained in the year 1300 its
dignity, as the ultimate court of appeal when in Council
assembled; but the Papacy had made gigantic strides
from the conditions of its tenure in the Cyprianic age.
The Vincentian test of Catholic doctrine by identity with
the past was being exchanged for submission to a living
authority in Rome. The ancient appeal to the Universal
Church was being exchanged for a theory which
identified the Roman Communion with the Catholic
Church. A strong and dangerous tendency had arisen
to substitute <i>à priori</i> conceptions of the appropriate
for appeal to ancient facts. Speculative theories of
ecclesiastical principle were being made a substitute,
-----File: p051.png--------------------------------------------------------
in Scripture reading, for real interpretation. Theories
were read into apostolic utterances from which they
could by no critical ingenuity be derived.

The greatest theologian of the Roman Church, St
Thomas Aquinas, is an embodiment of mediæval
theories of papal claims. He died in 1274. The treatise,
<i>De Regimine Principum</i>, whether his or not, was universally
ascribed to him in former days, and possessed for
many centuries the weight of his name and authority.
It represents, at any rate, the prevailing mediæval
view. By an obvious misuse of the metaphor that the
Pope is the Head of the Church, it draws the inference
that from the Head all understanding descends to the
Body. In the Pope is the plenitude or fulness of all
grace; for he alone confers plenary indulgence on all
sinners, so that the words originally applied to Christ
are also applicable to him: "of his fulness have all
we received." Certainly those who accepted habitually
this view were being prepared for the conclusion that
the Church was the passive recipient of the Pope's
infallible utterances.

And yet it by no means follows that St Thomas
Aquinas drew the infallibilist inferences, still less that
he taught the Vatican doctrine. It is acknowledged
by a recent Roman theologian[1] that while the theology
of the Middle Ages on the primacy attained in him
its climax, yet he has not developed the doctrine
systematically. In point of fact, from an infallibilist
standpoint, he still leaves much to be desired. He
taught that "we must not believe that the governor
of the Universal Church should wish to deceive anybody,
specially in those matters which the whole Church
receives and approves."[2] And he argued from this in

[Footnote 1: Schwane, <i>Hist. Dogm.</i>[**Dogme] v. p. 321.]

[Footnote 2: <i>In Sententiis</i>, 4 Disc. 20, a. 17.]
-----File: p052.png--------------------------------------------------------
behalf of the validity of indulgences which the Pope
preached and caused to be preached. But this passage
of Aquinas obviously admits of more than one construction.
It is general and vague. It does not
necessarily ascribe to the Pope any Infallibility at all.
It affirms that it would be wrong to credit the Pope
with a desire to deceive. It infers that indulgences
possess validity because the Pope proclaims them, but
also because it is a matter which the whole Church
receives and approves. The infallibilist writer Schwane[1]
urges that we must not infer from the phrase "which
the whole Church receives" that the Pope's Infallibility
depends on the Church's consent. But it seems
perfectly clear that to St Thomas's mind the reception
and approval by the whole Church of the doctrine in
question was precisely that which gave stability to
the papal utterance about it. He does not write
as if the Church's consent was a necessary sequel to
a papal decree. In point of fact, if this were so, any
reference to the Church's consent might seem superfluous,
since it could add nothing to the validity of
the Pope's instructions. But in Aquinas's argument for
indulgences the elements are two: the Church's reception
and approval of the doctrine, and the papal
utterance. And these are mutually supporting.

Elsewhere Aquinas says:--

"If any one rejected a decision after it had been
made by the authority of Universal Church, he would
be considered a heretic. And that authority chiefly
[principaliter] resides in the Supreme Pontiff."[2]
#/

But the exact force of his language is among his
interpreters a matter of dispute.

Bossuet held that the language of St Thomas on

[Footnote 1: <i>Hist. Dogm.</i> v. p. 321.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Summa</i>, 2, 2, Q. 11, a, 2, ad. 3.]
-----File: p053.png--------------------------------------------------------
Papal Infallibility is capable of a construction not
widely different from that of the School of Paris.[1] At
any rate the idea of an Infallibility completely independent
of any endorsement by the consent of the Church
is foreign to his mind. If, however, in spite of this
the Ultramontane claims him still, then appeal must
be made from St Thomas to the Fathers of an earlier
period.[2]

The value of St Thomas's theological inferences on the
subject has been challenged within the Roman Church
on the ground that he relied upon falsified authorities.
Pope Urban IV., intending to assist Aquinas's studies,
sent him a collection of assorted extracts from the
Fathers, calculated to refute the errors of the Gentile
world. Aquinas utilised this collection, confessedly,
says Schwane,[3] without much critical endeavour to
sift the true character of the extracts. The importance
of the passages may be gathered from the fact
already mentioned that the theologian Melchior Cano,
contemporary of the Council of Trent, considered them
to be the strongest evidence from the early Church in
behalf of Infallibility. Now it is admitted that this
collection of extracts is not genuine. "It appears," says
Schwane, himself an Ultramontane, "that the compiler
permitted himself to add here and there explanations."
Other passages he "developed." Schwane contends
that he has not absolutely falsified any; but admits
that he ascribed to St Cyril words which cannot be
found in the writings preserved to us. Schwane suggests
that, possibly, for all that, they might be genuine.
Turmel is much less sanguine about this possibility.
That Aquinas utilised his authorities in all sincerity
is indisputable. It is also indisputable that he was

deceived. This was urged very forcibly by Janus and
Gratry before the Vatican Decisions.

Some maintained that he would have arrived in any
case at the same conclusion. Others said that inferences
from falsified premises mistaken for the faith of saints
awaken serious doubt as to their validity. It was
also urged, and probably with truth, that these extracts
were not the basis of his doctrine on the primacy.
Still it was felt that they contributed to advance
ideas. It is an unwholesome pedigree, especially when
a Roman theologian calls these forged authorities the
strongest passages in the patristic evidences.

CHAPTER V

THE AGE OF THE REFORMING COUNCILS


The development of theories of papal power may
next be traced in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
Pursuing the method adopted hitherto, we will endeavour
to describe the facts as objectively as possible, and then
to relate the criticisms to which they have given rise
within the Roman obedience.

1. With the fourteenth century (1305) the Popes
transferred their residence from Rome to Avignon.
There they continued for seventy years. It was to
the papal prestige a period of unmixed calamity. The
authority of the Church was subordinated to France.
Rome made numerous overtures to secure the Popes'
return. Europe at large was jealous of the French
preponderating influence; and France was naturally
reluctant to lose its ascendancy.

But the "Babylonish Captivity of the Papacy," with
its inevitable effect on theories of papal power, was to
be followed by a worse disaster: the Great Schism of
forty years (1378-1417). On the death of Gregory XI.
in 1378 the Cardinals had before them a great alternative:
either to elect an Italian and so secure residence
in Rome, or to elect a Frenchman and so continue
the residence at Avignon. The Conclave met in Rome,
and was furiously beset by magistrates and people,
demanding a Roman or at least an Italian Pope.
-----File: p056.png--------------------------------------------------------
External pressure resulted in a hurried election and
the production of Urban VI. The Cardinals declared
him canonically elected and treated him for some months
as actual Pope. Then, under pretext that they had
acted under compulsion, partly, it is said, disgusted by
the new Pope's brutality, many Cardinals fled from
Rome, declared their election void, and appointed
Robert of Geneva Pope, as Clement VII. Men have
enquired, men still enquire, how should this double
election be esteemed? Which was the genuine Pope?
Was the election of Urban canonical? Was it
the result of intimidation? If the latter, does the
subsequent acknowledgment by the Cardinals cancel
irregularities? Or was Clement the real Pope?[1] This
is one of the problems of history.

The historian Pastor sides with Urban VI.[2] The
pretext that he was elected under compulsion will not
hold for a moment; for all the Cardinals took part
in his coronation, and assisted afterwards in his
ecclesiastical functions. They gave him homage as
Pope and proclaimed him to the world. Catherine of
Sienna told them plainly, "If what you say were as
true as it is false, must you not have lied when you proclaimed
him lawful Pope?"[3] In any case Christendom
was now divided into two obediences. This lasted for
forty years. The most learned canonists differed on
the question which of the two was the Vicar of Christ.
Distinguished teachers and saintly people were found
on either side, in equally good faith; and a Roman
writer declares himself unable to characterise either
with the title of Antipope.[4] Nations were divided,
so were cities and universities, into Urbanists and

-----File: p057.png--------------------------------------------------------
Clementines. Urban and Clement both died, but each
received successors. It looked as if Christendom might
witness a double headship becoming part of the
permanent constitution of the Church. It was the
glory of France, and, in particular, of the famous
University of Paris, then at the height of its power,
to intervene and take steps in behalf of unity. It
was now <sc>A.D.</sc> 1400. The Avignon line was now
represented by Peter de Luna, entitled Benedict XIII.;
the Italian line by Angelo Corario, entitled Gregory XII.
Christendom was scandalised by their mutual ex-communications.

The state of the Church was deplorable. Gregory
asserted that as Pope he was above law; Benedict that
no appeal from a Pope was permissible.[1] This, says
Bossuet, was the first time in Christendom that a Pope
ventured expressly to condemn all appeals from his
authority.[2] A recent historian of the Papacy says:--

/#
"The amount of evil wrought by the Schism of 1378,
the longest known in the history of the Papacy, can only
be estimated when we reflect that it occurred at a
moment when thorough reform in ecclesiastical affairs
was a most urgent need. This was now utterly out of
the question; and indeed all evils which had crept into
ecclesiastical life were infinitely increased. Respect for
the Holy See was also greatly impaired, and the Popes
became more than ever dependent on the temporal
power, for the Schism allowed each Prince to choose
which Pope he would acknowledge. In the eyes of the
people the simple fact of a double Papacy must have
shaken the authority of the Holy See to its very foundations.
It may truly be said that these fifty years of
Schism prepared the way for the great Apostasy of the
sixteenth century."[3]
#/

Through all this crisis, the Sorbonne, the theological

[Footnote 1: Bossuet, <i>Defense</i>, i. p. 567.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> ii. p. 325.]

[Footnote 3: Pastor, i. p. 142.]
-----File: p058.png--------------------------------------------------------
faculty of the University of Paris, was the strenuous
advocate of the doctrine that the supreme authority in
Christendom was the Council, not the Pope. They
declared that things were come to such a pass, through
the Schism, that on all sides men did not hesitate
publicly to affirm that it was purely indifferent whether
there were two Popes or twelve. Gerson, the celebrated
Chancellor of the University of Paris, reassured men by
asserting that the ultimate authority in Christendom
was the entire Church and not the Pope. This teaching
implies a denial of Papal Infallibility: and with this
teaching the entire Church in France was identified.

The perplexity of the situation forced upon men's
attention certain neglected aspects of ecclesiastical
truth. It compelled them to consider, what resources,
apart from the Pope, did the Church possess? The
rival Pontiffs scandalising Christendom by their selfish
indifference, as it appeared, to the Church's real interests,
challenged reflection on the relation between the Papacy
and the Church. Yet where was the authority competent
to intervene? Theories of papal power had
greatly developed since the age of Honorius. The
Pope's practical ascendancy was very different from that
which existed eight hundred years before. Habitual
acquiescence in large practical assumptions made it
harder now than in earlier times to find the true
solution. The problem, therefore, absorbed the gravest
attention of the ablest theologians of the day.

The Pope, said Gerson, is removable by his own
voluntary abdication.[1] This was historically exemplified
in the case of Pope Celestine, who, while he abdicated
the Papacy, is elevated among the saints. And if
removable by his own act, he must be also removable
by the Church, or by its representative, a General Council.

[Footnote 1: Gerson, <i>De Auferibilitate Papæ ab Ecclesia</i>.]
-----File: p059.png--------------------------------------------------------
For since he can give his Spouse a writing of divorcement,
she must possess an equal liberty. Moreover,
no office, dignity, or ministry, exists except for the
edification and good of the community. Many cases
may arise in which the Church will not be edified
unless the Pope either abdicates or is deposed. There
is no contradiction between this principle and the
legitimate sense of the injunction--"Touch not Mine
Anointed!" If the Greeks were willing to return to
unity conditionally on the removal of the existing Pope,
Gerson has no hesitation in saying that for the sake of
so great a blessing this concession should be made.

From discussion men advanced to action. The two
Colleges of Cardinals united, and summoned a Council
of the Church to be held at Pisa in 1409. The significance
of the Council of Pisa lies in its assumption of
superiority over Popes. The trend of several centuries
had been the other way. Now the balance of power
was asserted and employed. The explicit intention of
the Council was the healing of the Schism and the
reforming of the Church alike in its head and members.[1]
It declared its action necessary and lawful, and pledged
itself not to dissolve until it had effected a real reformation.
It discussed at full length the respective claimants
to the Roman See; and decided that Peter de Luna and
Angelo Corario, named in their respective obediences
Benedict XIII. and Gregory XII., were both schismatics,
and were hereby deposed. This deposition of Pope by
Council was hitherto unexampled.

The Roman See was now declared to be vacant, and
then the Council proceeded to fill the vacancy by the
creation of a new Pope under title of Alexander V.

It is generally admitted that this creation was unwise
because premature. Its success depended on the

[Footnote 1: Bonnechose, <i>C. Const.</i> i. p. 40.]
-----File: p060.png--------------------------------------------------------
consent of Christendom. And since neither Benedict
nor Gregory would resign, it resulted in a triple
obedience. To the Italian and Avignonese lines was
now added the Pisan.[1] Alexander V. vainly denounced
those "two monstrous sons of perdition"; and then, after
an exemplary pontificate of ten months, died at Bologna,
and was replaced by the notorious and unfortunate,
Balthasar Cossa, Master of Bologna, who assumed the
style of John XXIII. Between these three Popes there
followed the routine of mutual anathema and excommunication,
which continued to lower the dignity
of the Papacy in the esteem of Europe. Thus the
Council of Pisa failed to heal the afflicted Church, or
remedy the Schism.

In the Council of Constance, 1414, the attempt was
made again. Briefly, after numerous struggles John
XXIII., Benedict XIII., and Gregory XII., were all
declared deposed, and eventually this sentence, through
the influence of the Emperor Sigismund, prevailed. A
new Pope was created in the person of Martin V. The
three obediences were reunited, and the peace of the
Church restored.

The main interest of this Council, however, lies in its
famous declaration. It claimed to be an Ecumenical
Council, legitimately assembled with the authority of
the Holy Spirit, representing the Catholic Church, having
its power direct from Jesus Christ. Accordingly, to its
decision in matters of faith as well as in other things,
persons of whatever rank, including papal, are subordinate.

/#
"This holy Synod of Constance, being a General
Council, lawfully assembled in the Holy Spirit, and
representing the Church militant, has received immediately
from Jesus Christ a power to which all persons of
whatever rank and dignity, not excepting the Pope
#/

[Footnote 1: Baronius, <i>Annals</i>.]
-----File: p061.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
himself, are bound to submit in those matters which
concern the faith; the extirpation of the existing
Schism; and the reformation of the Church in its
head and its members."
#/

/#
"Whosoever, be his dignity what it may, without
excepting the Pope, shall obstinately refuse to obey
the statutes, ordinances, and precepts of the present
Council, or of any other General Council lawfully
assembled, shall be subjected, unless he repent, to
proportionate penance, and punished according to his
deserts" (etc.).
#/

2. So far, then, for the details of history. We are
next to follow the criticisms of theological schools within
the Roman Communion upon the facts. Bellarmine,
the Jesuit theologian, was a Cardinal in 1600. While
claiming for the Pope a supremacy and Infallibility, in
the most uncompromising terms, and with a fulness
and clearness hitherto unexampled, he was naturally
challenged to harmonise his theories with the facts of
the Councils of the fifteenth century.

It was argued that the Council of Constance possessed
an ecumenical character. Now either this claim is
legitimate or it is not. If it is, we must accept its
principles, which affirm that an Ecumenical Council
has its authority direct from Christ, and that all, of
whatever rank, including papal, are subjected to its
decisions. If it is not, then its work in deposing
John XXIII., Gregory XII., and Benedict XIII., and
in replacing them by Martin V. is invalid, and cannot
be sustained. Consequently, the whole line of Martin's
successors is also illegitimate.

Bellarmine denied that Constance was an Ecumenical
Council. For, he said, it included only a third of the
Church, one obedience out of three. He denied also
that its election of Martin V. was thereby invalidated.
An assembly may have power to elect, but not to
-----File: p062.png--------------------------------------------------------
define in matters of faith. Constance possessed exceptional
power in an exceptional time. For a
doubtful Pope is no Pope at all.

With regard to the ecumenical character of the Council
of Constance, Bossuet replied to Bellarmine that his
criticism upon it did not go far enough. For the
Council described itself as a general Synod assembled
in the Holy Spirit, rightly and justly summoned,
opened, and enacted. Now this account of itself is
either a simple truth, or a blasphemous assumption.
Its opponents dare not venture to call it the latter.

It is also quite misleading to say, as Bellarmine does,
that the Council of Constance represented only one
out of three obediences. As a matter of fact, the
vast majority of Christendom was represented there.
The adherents of Gregory XII. and Benedict XIII.
had by that time dwindled to relative insignificance.
The great nationalities, the theological faculties, the
religious orders, were all on the Council's side. If
insignificant fractions, with Popes of doubtful claims,
still remained for a period aloof, this did not seriously
affect the claims of Constance to a representative
character in Christendom. Still less is it possible that
their claim to authority as assembled in the Holy
Ghost, and constituting a General Council, can be
condemned as a falsehood and a blasphemy.

Bellarmine himself admitted that the Council of Basle
decided with the Legate's consent that the Council is
above the Pope, which is certainly <i>now</i> considered
erroneous. Now! echoes Bossuet: that is a sign of
novelty. And by whom? By a private theologian.
Is, then, the opinion of a private teacher to be set
above the unanimous decree of a Universal Council
presided over by the Legates of the Apostolic See?[1]

[Footnote 1: Bossuet, t. xxi. p. 57.]
-----File: p063.png--------------------------------------------------------

The argument that these Councils possessed exceptional
power in an exceptional time was, according to
Bossuet,[1] refuted by the Councils themselves. No doubt
the Assembly of Constance declared its mission to be
the termination of the Schism, and the union and
reformation of the Church in its head and members--a
temporary work. But it also affirmed that it was the
duty of all men of whatever rank and condition, even
papal, to submit to the authority not only of this
Council, but also of every other General Council lawfully
assembled. Thus the supremacy of the Council
is asserted to be not a mere temporary expedient to
solve exceptional difficulties, but an inherent characteristic
of the Universal Church in this representative form
of self-expression.

Bellarmine's second main argument against the
Council of Constance was that Pope Martin V. never
confirmed its decrees. This involved two points: a
speculative theory of the nature of papal confirmation;
and also a question of fact. Bossuet replied to the
speculative theory that confirmation of the acts of a
Council did not imply what Bellarmine supposed; for
Popes have often confirmed the acts and decrees of
their predecessors, which certainly on Ultramontane
principles could not be interpreted as imparting to them
a validity not possessed before. Confirmation merely
meant acceptance, assent. Beyond it lay the further
enquiry: What is the inherent value of a Universal
Council's decree apart from papal acceptance? Bossuet
would answer that question one way, Bellarmine another.
And in so doing each would have his followers; for
each represented schools of thought within the Roman
Communion.

Then as to the question of fact:

[Footnote 1: <i>Works</i>, t. xxi. p. 551.]
-----File: p064.png--------------------------------------------------------

Bellarmine's assertion that Martin V. did not accept
the decisions of Constance is, according to Bossuet,
particularly unfortunate. For Martin V. was, as Cardinal
Colonna, present through the sessions of Pisa and of
Constance, and influential in passing the Council's claims
to be ecumenical and assembled in the Holy Spirit.
And yet this Cardinal, without any revocation of this
opinion, was elected to the Papal See. Martin's own
mind on the authority of General Councils is sufficiently
clear. All that Bellarmine found to urge was that
Martin said he confirmed what had been done <i>conciliariter</i>;
that is, says Bellarmine, in the proper way,
as Councils should: which he interpreted to mean, after
careful examination into facts--a condition which was
not fulfilled at Constance. And, therefore, Martin did
not intend to confirm this claim.

Bossuet considered that nothing could exceed the
feebleness of the argument. The Roman Pontiffs, says
Bossuet, have never spoken of the Council of Constance
without veneration; have never passed any adverse
criticism upon it. Paul V. had its proceedings published
by the Vatican, complete, on a level of authority with
the Council of Nicea.[1]

The long struggle of the fifteenth century between
two conceptions of Ecclesiastical Authority--that which
placed the ultimate decision in the Collective Episcopate,
and that which placed it in the solitary Voice--issued,
on the whole, to the advantage of the latter. However
great the services which the reforming Council rendered
to Christendom, and great undoubtedly they were, yet
the blunders perpetrated by them, and their ultimate
collapse, seriously compromised their rightful claims.
The Papacy had learnt lessons it was never likely to
forget, and the following period was instinctively a

[Footnote 1: Bossuet, <i>Works</i>, t. xxi. p. 53.]
-----File: p065.png--------------------------------------------------------
period of self-protection and recovered authority.
Wonderful as it seems, even the characters of
Alexander VI., Julius II., and Leo X. did not
prevent an advance of the papal power over the limits
which it occupied in the previous period. None of
these individuals asserted their Infallibility. Their
interests were elsewhere. Pope Hadrian VI. was
successor to Leo X. As Professor of Theology at
Louvain, he published the following observations on
Infallibility:--

/#
"If by the Roman Church is understood its head,
that is the Pope, it is certain that it can err, even in
those matters which concern the Faith, by publishing
heresy in its decisions and decrees. For many Roman
Pontiffs have been heretics. Of recent times it is
reported that Pope John XXII. publicly taught, declared,
and commanded to be believed by all, that purified souls
do not have the clear vision of God before the Final
Judgment."
#/

Bossuet calls the readers[**F1:no ' ?] attention to Pope Hadrian's
view of the Papacy.[1] How clearly he taught, and held
as indisputable, that the Pope could be a heretic not
only in his private capacity, but in his official decisions
and decrees! How emphatically he rejects what his
predecessor "publicly taught, declared, and commanded
to be believed by all!" Whether any explanation of
the teaching of Pope John XXII. can be attempted
is not to the point. In any case the fact remains
that Hadrian VI. held these ideas of Papal Fallibility.
And if he wrote this as a theologian, before his
elevation to the Papacy, there is no trace that he ever
retracted his doctrine, as he must have done had
he come to think it erroneous. On the contrary, he
published it after becoming Pope (1522).

CHAPTER VI

THE COUNCIL OF TRENT


The next crisis between papal and episcopal theories
of authority is reached in the <i>Council of Trent</i>. The
primary purpose of that Assembly was to reply to those
without, rather than to determine opinions within the
Roman Communion. But the effort to formulate their
own convictions disclosed sharply contested theories
within. The conflict of opposing schools became particularly
conspicuous when the Sacrament of Orders
came up for consideration in November 1562. The
century and a half between Constance and Trent had
somewhat diminished the impression of the Schism.
Teaching on the supremacy of the Council over the
Pope was naturally less emphatic now than in those
disastrous days. Yet the school which considered the
Pope supreme, and that which considered the Collective
Episcopate to hold that high position, coexisted within
the Roman Body; just as the entire previous development
would lead us to expect. In the Council Chamber
of Trent, from the lips of Bishops, both theories are
sharply stated.

On the papal side it was claimed that consecration
to the Episcopate confers orders but not jurisdiction.
Jurisdiction is the authority to govern the Christian
flock. And it was argued that a Bishop does not
-----File: p067.png--------------------------------------------------------
necessarily possess jurisdiction. He possesses jurisdiction
when the flock has been assigned to him.
But, said the papal advocates, it is the Pope who
gives to the Bishop his flock. Consequently, it is the
Pope who confers the jurisdiction.

The real basis of this theory is the opinion that all
jurisdiction was originally conferred by Christ upon
St Peter; that it belongs exclusively to him and his
successors; that the plenary jurisdiction of St Peter
was transmitted, but not that of the other Apostles.
The papal advocates in the Council of Trent frankly
stated their anxiety to protect the papal power. If the
Pope in conveying jurisdiction was only instrumental,
then the plenitude of power was not really his. But
whatever the Bishops are, the Pope must be the source
of all authority. It was even asserted that Bishops
are superior to priests not by divine right, but by papal
permission. The Pope, it was declared, had power to
deprive, transfer, or depose the Bishops at will, as might
seem to him expedient for the Universal or the local
Church. So, at least, a Bishop said. We shall see
this theory bearing fruits in France in the days of
Napoleon. Another Bishop even proclaimed that our
Lord baptized St Peter only among the Apostles, while
Peter baptized the rest, and created them Bishops of
the Church.

On the other side, the theory of supreme episcopal
right, commission, and authority was firmly and widely
maintained. Consecration, it was affirmed, conferred
jurisdiction as well as orders. Indeed jurisdiction is
essential to the episcopal function; and consecration
cannot confer an inadequate mutilated power. In
jurisdiction we should distinguish the capacity and
its exercise. The capacity is bestowed direct by
Christ in consecration; the particular sphere of its
-----File: p068.png--------------------------------------------------------
exercise is accidental and subordinate. Appeal was
made to the Council of Constance in support of
this. Accordingly, Bishops are Vicars of Christ.
They are also successors of the Apostles. All the
Apostles received jurisdiction direct from Christ. The
Bishops are their true successors, therefore their
right is divine. The divine right of the Pope can
be rested on no other ground than on his succession
to St Peter. By an equal reason the Bishops are
successors of the Apostles. Christ did not only
institute Peter and his successors, but also the Apostles
and theirs. In the primitive Church, so Bishops
argued at Trent, the papal theory did not exist. For
Titus and Timothy were appointed by St Paul, and
others by the other Apostles, without any authority from
or reference to the Supreme Pontiff. Indeed the Keys
of the Kingdom of Heaven were given to St Peter, but
not to him alone.

Between these conflicting schools others endeavoured
to mediate. A member of the Council thought it almost
sacrilege to go on discussing the Pope's authority when
they had no mandate so to do. Another pleaded that
no discussion should be held on episcopal jurisdiction.
The condemnation of either opinion would be the
repudiation of many accredited teachers. Another
deprecated controverted points. What, he exclaimed,
will the heretics say when they hear that we, after
fifteen hundred years, are enquiring by what right
Bishops exist? These questions should be avoided as
encouraging heretics and scandalising Catholics. The
proper theme for the Council's consideration was rather,
How is the episcopal office to be rightly discharged?
This is what the world expects the Council to decide.
Thus he recalled them to practical reform. Vainly did
the presiding Legate remind them that the Council
-----File: p069.png--------------------------------------------------------
was called to condemn heretics, not to discuss matters
controverted among Catholics.

But party feeling was very strong. A Spanish Bishop
ventured to observe that the Canon of Nicaea (4)
on Episcopal consecration made no reference whatever
to the Pope. This created an uproar. The Italian
Bishops shouted, "Anathema, burn him, he is a heretic."

The meeting closed in indescribable confusion. When
the subject was resumed, on the following day, the
Legates expressed themselves firmly resolved to maintain
the dignity of the Council, even if necessary by
dissolving the Assembly. The Cardinal de Lorraine,
head of the Bishops from France, supported the Legates.
He is said to have observed that if such an insult had
been offered to a French Bishop, he would have left
the Council with all the French contingent and returned
to France. Cardinal de Lorraine made no secret of his
adherence to the principles of the French Church.

/#
"I am a Gallican," he said in a letter to Rome,
"brought up in the University of Paris, in which the
authority of a General Council is esteemed superior to
that of a Pope, and they who hold the contrary are
condemned as heretics. In France the Council of
Constance is throughout considered Ecumenical."[1]
#/

It is said that if the question had been pressed by
the presiding Legates to a division, they could have
obtained a majority. But they could not have obtained,
on the disputed points, anything approaching unanimity.
Accordingly, the controversy on the source of episcopal
jurisdiction was left finally undetermined. So far as
the Decisions of Trent are concerned there was nothing
on this matter to prohibit retention of the ancient view.

There was an anxiety in Rome not to push things

[Footnote 1: Richerius, <i>Vindiciæ Gall.</i> p. 13.]
-----File: p070.png--------------------------------------------------------
to antagonism and division. An historian of the Council
says that the Pope advised the Legates that nothing
should be defined without the Bishops' unanimous
consent:[1] a maxim to which constant appeal was
made from the Age of Trent to that of the Vatican.[2]
The appeal was natural, for this maxim harmonised
with the principle that the ultimate decision in faith
rested with the Collective Episcopate.

Since Spanish and French opposition in the Council
of Trent frustrated any endorsement of Italian theories
of jurisdiction, it is clear what would have been the
result of any attempt to make decrees on papal authority.
No further addition was made in this direction. Belief
in the supreme authority of the Council in matters of
faith was left, so far as Trent was concerned, exactly
where it was before. It remained the conviction of the
Church in France.

The correspondence between Rome and the Legates
at Trent has never been published yet. Members of
the Council of the Vatican asked permission to see it,
but Theiner, librarian of the Vatican, was not allowed
to show the documents. Lord Acton[3] says that Theiner
deemed the concealment prudent.

Whether that opinion is correct or not, and it has
been disputed, what is certain is that if a comparison
be made between the relation of Pope and Council
at Trent and at the Vatican, a vast development of
papal authority will be found in the later period, and
a corresponding diminution of the independent action
of the Collective Episcopate. It will be sufficient
here to note that at Trent the claims of minorities
were respected; that nothing was passed without moral
unanimity; that the Bishops framed the regulations by

[Footnote 3: <i>Hist. Freedom</i>, p. 431.]
-----File: p071.png--------------------------------------------------------
which they were to be controlled; that no methods
of procedure were imposed upon them from without;
that the Roman Pontiff of that day made no attempt
to force new dogmas on large and reluctant minorities.
These comparisons were made within the Roman
Church, when the later Assembly had shown its
character.

CHAPTER VII

CARDINAL BELLARMINE


Nothing can better illustrate the development of
thought on the papal power after the Council of Trent
than the theories of Cardinal Bellarmine. A nephew of
one Pope and friend of another, a Jesuit, resident in
Rome, a Cardinal in 1600, he strikingly represents the
extreme tendencies of the Italian School. He put forth
to the world in his volumes of <i>Controversies</i> a systematic
and elaborated conception of supremacy and Infallibility
certainly unsurpassed.

The supremacy of Peter is upheld on the ground that
our Lord said to him in the Apostles' presence, "Feed my
sheep." In this injunction all sheep must be included.
And therefore the Apostles themselves are sheep whom
Peter must feed. While the Apostles, it may be admitted,
derive their jurisdiction direct from Christ, the Bishops
receive it direct from the Pope. Confirmation of this
principle is sought in the relation of Moses to the
Elders, and also in the monarchical character of the
Church's constitution. According to Bellarmine, it
is essential to the monarchical idea that all authority
reside in one, and from that one be communicated to
others. The Bishops are not successors of the Apostles;
since the latter were not ordinary but extraordinary and
delegated pastors, and as such have no successors at
-----File: p073.png--------------------------------------------------------
all. From these principles the relation of the Collective
Episcopate, or Ecumenical Council, to the Pope may be
readily imagined. Existing theories as to Papal Infallibility
are grouped by Bellarmine as four. First, that the
Pope, even with an Ecumenical Council, can be a heretic
and teach heresy, and has actually so done. This is the
opinion of Lutheran and Calvinist. Secondly, that the
Pope, if he speak apart from an Ecumenical Council,
can be a heretic and teach heresy, and has actually done
so. This is the Parisian view, held by Gerson and Pope
Hadrian VI. Thirdly, that the Pope cannot possibly,
under any circumstances, be a heretic nor teach heresy.
For this opinion Bellarmine only quotes one writer
(Pighius), of whom Bossuet observes that nobody
endorses his absurdities. Fourthly, that the Pope,
whether he can be a heretic or not, cannot define anything
heretical to be believed by the whole Church.
This Bellarmine calls the most prevalent opinion of
nearly all Catholics. He admits that various advocates
of it interpolate various conditions of its exercise, such as
consultation with his advisers, mature reflection, and so
forth. But he thinks that they would deny that these
conditions can ever be unfulfilled; on the ground that
God who designs the end must also arrange the means.

Of these four opinions Bellarmine proceeds to pronounce
the first heretical. The second he will not
venture to term actually heretical, because its advocates
are, so far, tolerated by the Church. This audacious
statement should be read in the light of the entire
previous history of Christendom. Yet Bellarmine holds
it erroneous, and proximate to heresy; and that it
might deservedly be declared heretical by a decision of
the Church. The third opinion he pronounces probable,
but not certain.

The last is most certain, and to be taught. He
-----File: p074.png--------------------------------------------------------
supports it by asserting that no appeal is ever permissible
from a Pope to a General Council; that not
only the Pope himself is inerrable in matters of faith,
but even the particular Roman Church in Italy cannot
err. This opinion at least is pious and most probable;
although not so certain that the contrary can be called
heretical. But, even with this, Bellarmine does not feel
that his wonderful construction is yet secure. Accordingly
he asserts that it is probable, and may be piously
believed, not that the Pontiff cannot officially err, but
even that as a particular individual he cannot be a
heretic, or pertinaciously believe anything contrary to the
faith. This appears to Bellarmine essential to protect
the Pope's official Infallibility. For how, he asks, could
a Pope, if inwardly heretical, strengthen his brethren in
faith and teach the truth? No doubt the Almighty
could extort a true confession from the heart of a
heretic just as He put true words in the mouth of
Balaam's ass. But, to Bellarmine's reflection, this procedure
would be violent, and hardly in accord with
that Providential Wisdom which sweetly disposeth all
things.

After this elevation of papal authority to the highest
height, there necessarily follows a corresponding depreciation
of the value of the Collective Episcopate
and its utterances in Council assembled. General
Councils, before the Pope confirms their decisions, may
err, unless the Fathers in defining follow the Pope's
instructions. He is aware that the School of Paris,
and all who maintain the supremacy of the Council
over the Pope, will reject this. The Parisian Doctors
hold that a General Council cannot err even apart
from papal confirmation. But if it could not err then
it would be final; and if so, where would be space for
papal confirmation? Accordingly Bellarmine could not
-----File: p075.png--------------------------------------------------------
possibly endorse their view. He knows that his
opponents will retort: General Councils anathematise
those who contradict; they do not restrain their
anathemas until the Pope has confirmed them. Bellarmine
answers: They must certainly mean that their
anathemas are conditional on the Pope's endorsement!

What forces Bellarmine to these eccentricities is
his opinion that no authority was given by Christ to
the Universal Church but only to St Peter. Consequently,
if the General Council represent the Universal
Church, yet it cannot possess what the entire Body did
not receive. To Bellarmine's view the Supreme Pontiff
is simply and absolutely above the Universal Church,
and above the General Council; so that no judgment
on earth can be superior to his. If the objection be
urged that on this theory the Church is left in case of
trouble without a remedy: Bellarmine answers, No;
there is the divine Protection. We may pray God to
convert the Pope, or to take him away before he
ruins the Church.

It is certainly one of the ironies of history that the
volume of <i>Controversies</i>, in which these theories are
contained, was placed on the Index by Pope Sixtus V.
as deficient, in certain respects, in the regard which a
Catholic owed to the Holy Father. In the curiously
self-laudatory pages of Bellarmine's <i>Autobiography</i>
there still survives his own comment on this act of
papal authority. He informs us that in the year 1591
Gregory XIV. was reflecting what he ought to do
with the Vulgate edited by Sixtus V. There were
not wanting men of importance who held that the
use of this edition ought to be publicly prohibited.
But Bellarmine suggested, in the Pope's presence, that
correction was better than prohibition. Thus the
honour of Pope Sixtus would be saved, and the book
-----File: p076.png--------------------------------------------------------
produced in an emended form. He advised, therefore,
a republication after correction, with a preface stating
that in the first edition various errors, typographical
and other, had, through haste, crept in. Thus, says
Bellarmine, he did Pope Sixtus good in return for evil.
For Sixtus placed Bellarmine's work on <i>Controversies</i>
upon the Index of Prohibited Books, because it rejected
the direct dominion of the Pope over the whole world.
But, when Pope Sixtus was dead, the Congregation of
Sacred Rites ordered the prohibition of Bellarmine's
work to be erased.[1]

The theories of Roman theologians made great
advances in the sixteenth century. But it is curious
to note that some of the most extreme are yet considered
inadequate and defective by papal writers since
the Vatican Decrees. Torquemada was a theologian
devoted to the enhancement of the Apostolic See.[2]
For him the plenitude of power existed in the Pope
alone. Was it not written there shall be one fold and
one shepherd? For him all the other Apostles derived
their jurisdiction from St Peter. And, accordingly, all
Bishops derive their jurisdiction immediately from the
Pope, and not from Christ. But notwithstanding all
this, Torquemada does not come up to Ultramontane
requirements. The German infallibilist, Schwane, is
not satisfied with him as an advocate of Papal
Infallibility.

/#
"Infallibility of the Pope," says Schwane, "could not
be passed over in silence by a papal theologian as
eminent as Torquemada. Nevertheless, he has not
realised this doctrine in all its purity."[3]
#/

[Footnote 1: Cf. Döllinger und Reusch, <i>Die Selbstbiographie des Cardinals Bellarmin</i>,
p. 38, and notes pp. 106-111.]

[Footnote 2: Ghilardi, <i>De Plenitudine Potestatis</i>, <i>R.P.</i>[**single set of italics?] p. 15.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Hist. Dogm.</i>, v. p. 377.]
-----File: p077.png--------------------------------------------------------

Torquemada, it appears, had such regard for papal
freedom of will that he could not deny the possibility
of its erroneous exercise, even in the discharge of the
highest papal function. But while admitting that the
Pope might err in an official utterance to the whole
Church, he evaded the disastrous consequence to the
doctrine of Infallibility by affirming that such a misuse
of authority would constitute the Pope a heretic, and,
as such, <i>ipso facto</i>, Pope no longer. Thus he secures the
Papal Infallibility by maintaining the self-deposition of
any Pope who teaches erroneously.

Schwane remarks acutely enough that Torquemada's
defence of Papal Infallibility virtually places the supreme
decision not in the Pope but in a General Council of the
Church. For it manifestly tends to ascribe to General
Councils the right to revise all papal dogmatic decrees,
in order to ascertain whether they are heretical or not;
whether they proceed from one who is really Pope, or
from one who, having taught erroneously, is not Pope
at all.

To avoid these dangerous tendencies Torquemada,
according to Schwane, ought to have denied the
possibility of the Pope's misuse of free will in his
<i>ex cathedra</i> pronouncements; and this on the ground
that the promises of Christ cannot fail to secure
their own fulfilment, and must accordingly override the
metaphysical possibility of mistake. This theory of
the unconditional character of Christ's promises, of the
almost mechanical necessity of their realisation, irrespective
of the human will and human compliance, constantly
meets us in recent Ultramontane developments.
Torquemada, however, knew nothing about all this, or
did not see his way to accept such theories. There
remain, therefore, grave discrepancies, according to
recent Roman writers, between this papal theologian
-----File: p078.png--------------------------------------------------------
of the sixteenth century--papal though indeed he was,--and
the doctrine as it shaped itself in the Vatican
Decrees. This inadequacy of its defenders, as judged
by the standard of the nineteenth century decision, is
a not unimportant feature in the doctrine's development.

CHAPTER VIII

THE SORBONNE


During the seventeenth century Ultramontanism found
its principal obstruction in the Church of France, its
principal support in the Jesuit Society. The progress of
the theory roughly corresponded with the vicissitudes of
this powerful community. The League against the succession
in France exchanged monarchical and Gallican sentiments
for Republican and Ultramontane. The theories
of political independence and ecclesiastical absolutism
flourished for a time. Ultramontanism even controlled
for a time the very stronghold of Gallican doctrine--the
Sorbonne itself. But this cannot be rightly regarded as
anything more than a transient politically affected phase.
The Sorbonne returned to its ancient loyalties. It
possessed no longer the same authority and weight as
in the disastrous days of the great Schism; but it
still imposed a powerful check on the theories of the
Ultramontane. Its influence was often compromised,
sometimes counterbalanced, by the Jesuit Society which,
supported by an Italian Queen Regent during the
minority of Louis XIII., was enabled to effect gradual
encroachments upon the ancient University, by founding
colleges and, ultimately, granting degrees, even in
Paris itself.[1] Cardinal Richelieu, rebuilder and lavish

[Footnote 1: Cf. Jourdain, <i>Hist. Univ. Paris</i>.]
-----File: p080.png--------------------------------------------------------
patron of the Sorbonne though he was, could, nevertheless,
for political reasons, encourage the Jesuit
foundations; on the pretext that rival educational
establishments sharpened the wits of both. Thus the
first half of the century witnessed the perpetual
efforts of the Sorbonne to strengthen the theological
principles of the French Church, and to exclude the
Ultramontane, thwarted or weakened by the influence
of the Jesuit exercised through the Palace. Jesuit
confessors directed the Royal consciences, and made
them inaccessible to the protests of the Sorbonne.
Again and again theological discussions were suspended
or suppressed by royal authority, at the secret
instigation of this powerful community. A notable
instance is found in the experiences of the celebrated
Edmond Richer, the learned Syndic of the Sorbonne,
in the opening years of the seventeenth century.
Richer had been in early youth a member of the
League, and, as such, a Republican and an Ultramontane;
but his matured reflections led him to embrace
the historic principles of the Church of France, and to
become a truceless foe of the Jesuits, and of the Ultramontane
opinions with which they were at the time
identified. In the year 1606 he distinguished himself
by republishing the works of Chancellor Gerson. In
1611 the opposing School proposed for discussion at
a Dominican Convent in Paris, before an illustrious
assembly, including royal personages, the Papal Nuncio,
and Cardinal du Perron, the following thesis:--(1) That
the Roman Pontiff cannot err in faith and morals;
(2) that the Council is in no case superior to the
Pope.[1] Richer, as Syndic of the Sorbonne, protested.
The forbearance of the Gallicans was sorely tried by
such contradictions to the principles of their fathers.

[Footnote 1: Richerius, <i>Vindiciæ Gall.</i>]
-----File: p081.png--------------------------------------------------------
Ultimately it was arranged that a member of the
Sorbonne, Claudius Bertin, should advocate the Gallican
side. Bertin began with the syllogism: Whatever contradicts
an Ecumenical Council is heresy. Your thesis--the
Council is in no case superior to the Pope--contradicts
the Ecumenical Council of Constance, therefore
it is heresy. At this the Papal Nuncio grew visibly
indignant. Bertin's opponent mildly answered: "Do not
say this assertion is heretical; it is enough to call it
misleading, erroneous." He disclaimed any desire to
offend the Faculty of Paris. He only desired to
ascertain the truth. And where in all the world could
this question be discussed if not within this most
famous University? Here Richer, the Syndic, interposed.
The Sorbonne had always held the Council
of Constance as Ecumenical, and, accordingly, that its
decision on the supremacy of the Council over the
Pope was a matter of faith.

The discussion was resumed, but ultimately, at Cardinal
du Perron's request, and evidently in the Ultramontane
interests, brought to an abrupt conclusion. The Parliament
of Paris followed this up with an injunction prohibiting
the Dominicans from disputes on the Pope's
Infallibility.

The Jesuits were so enraged by Richer's action that
from that day forward they never gave him peace.
They were powerful enough to secure his dismissal from
office. But he was a person more easily dismissed than
suppressed. He wrote a pamphlet on ecclesiastical and
political power, to show that the Church is a monarchy,
but its government an aristocracy; for neither the Pope
nor the other Bishops can decide matters of importance
without the guidance of a Council. The infallible
authority in matters of faith rests, he taught, with the
Universal Council as representing the Universal Church.
-----File: p082.png--------------------------------------------------------
This work offended Cardinal du Perron, who could not
see how proper regard for monarchy was consistent
with the view that aristocracy was naturally the highest
form of government.[1] Meanwhile Richer retired contentedly
into studious quietude, where he composed his
great work on the Councils, published after his death.
But his enemies could not let him rest. He says that
he could not venture beyond the gates of the College
lest the satellites of the Roman authorities should fall
upon him.[2] From the treatment measured out to him
he sees that the Roman Curia is resolved to obliterate
the ancient doctrine of the School of Paris, and to
allow no man to speak of the true government of the
Church, or the independence of the State, without
branding him as a heretic or schismatic.[3] It is said that
Richer was forced by menaces to sign a recantation of
his views of papal power. Whatever he signed, the
independent statements of his own literary <i>Testament</i>
remain to show his real convictions.

/#
"I, Edmond Richer ... in the 53 year of my life
... seated in my library, sound in body and mind,
write this latin codicil in the form of a Testament."[4]
#/

He then appeals to his defence of the ancient principles
in the Disputations of 1611; and recalls the persecutions
he has undergone: how it was said that a vow
to assassinate him would be most acceptable to God,
or that if he were snared and sent to Rome he would
soon find out whether the Pope possessed the temporal
sword.[5] Men do not realise, says Richer, how grievously
these theories compromise the Apostolic See. For more

[Footnote 5: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 14.]
-----File: p083.png--------------------------------------------------------
than twenty years he has been beset by enemies. And
yet they are the true principles of Church government,
transmitted by the Fathers, restored in the Councils
of Constance and Basle, which are being attacked
through him.[1] The example of Richer is intended as
a warning to frighten the theologians of Paris from
maintaining the doctrine of their fathers. Accordingly
whatever his malicious opponents may contrive
at this day, or may hereafter contrive against him,
he prays that he may have the grace to forgive
and the fortitude to resist. In this unhappy age in
which truth is diminished among the children of
men he registers his emphatic rejection of the theory
that the Pope is the absolute infallible ruler of the
Church.[2]

Undoubtedly this was the faith in which Richer died.[3]

Another instance of the teaching of the French
Church occurs in a book by Francis Veron, entitled
<i>The Rule of Faith</i>, or a separation of those matters
which are of Catholic faith from those that are not.
Veron was Doctor of Theology in Paris, and died
in 1646.[4] He quotes the doctrine of Trent and
Florence. Trent committed him to the recognition of
the Roman Church as the Mother and Mistress of all
Churches; to the belief that the Roman Pontiff is Peter's
successor and Vicar of Christ; and to the duty of
obedience to his commands. The Council of Florence
described the Pope as Head of the whole Church, and as
Father and Teacher of all Christians; and affirmed him
to possess a plenary power, such as is recognised in the
Acts of the Ecumenical Councils, and in the canons.
So much, then, Veron acknowledges as of faith. But

[Footnote 1: Richerius, <i>Vindiciæ Doctrinæ Majorum</i>, p. 14.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> 16-17.]

[Footnote 3: <sc>A.D.</sc> 1629.]

[Footnote 4: Ed. Sebastian Brunner, 1857, p. 145.]
-----File: p084.png--------------------------------------------------------
nothing beyond this is of faith, because the Church has
asserted nothing more. He lays particular stress on
the language of Florence, because Greek and Latin
were therein met in conclave.

/#
"Accordingly," Veron's conclusion is that, "it is not
of faith that the Roman Pontiff, in his teaching, whether
in a particular Council, or in a Provincial Synod, even
if he address the Universal Church, or when, as they
say, he speaks <i>ex cathedra</i>, supposing him to teach
apart from a Universal Council, is the supreme judge
of controversies, or is infallible; nor that what is so
defined is of faith, unless the conviction of the Universal
Church otherwise declare it."[1]
#/

According to the doctrine of Trent it is the Church
alone whose function it is to determine the true meaning
and interpretation of Holy Scripture. No theologian
hitherto, says Veron, not even Bellarmine himself, has
ventured to assert that the Pope's Infallibility is of faith.[2]
Bellarmine admits that the theory that the Pope, if he
venture to define even as Pope apart from a General
Council, may fall into heresy, was held by no less a
personage than the theologian who afterwards became
Pope Hadrian VI.[3] Bellarmine admits also that this
theory is not heretical, for its advocates are tolerated
by the Church. If Bellarmine, nevertheless, labels this
same theory proximate to heresy, this is his individual
view and in Veron's judgment unjustifiable. As to
further discussion, Veron deprecates it[**typo missing "." ?] He writes as
a Catholic teacher and not in a scholastic or speculative
way.

"Since the Catholic Church teaches nothing concerning
this matter, [of Papal Infallibility] neither need I."[4]
What is true is that whatever issues from so high an
authority is to be received with great regard.

CHAPTER IX

BOSSUET


The struggle between the Sorbonne and the Jesuits was
no mere struggle between a theological school and a
religious community. The universities held, in the
theological controversies of those days, a position with
which nothing modern exactly corresponds. They were
exponents of the religious conceptions of the Church.
They derived from it their principles and returned to
it their inferences and suggestions. The Sorbonne
was not an isolated school of independent theological
speculators. It represented, generally speaking, the
mind of the Church in France. Of course universities
might utter conflicting decisions. But it is peculiarly
true of the Sorbonne that it represented the indigenous
as opposed to the imported theology of France. While
the Ultramontane was Italian in origin, a foreign
product, like the Jesuit, and under foreign control, the
Sorbonne was typical of the traditions of the Church
within the Kingdom. Its sentiments were endorsed by
the Bishops. Political incidents occasioned the famous
collective expression of the traditional convictions of
the French Church in the Assembly of Clergy in 1682.
That Assembly arose out of an unexpected collision
between Louis XIV. and Pope Innocent XI., in a
question of the relation between the Church and the
-----File: p086.png--------------------------------------------------------
State. The King already possessed over a portion of
France the power, fully recognised at Rome, to appoint
to vacant benefices and to be recipient of the revenues
during a vacancy. But he now sought to make this
privilege co-extensive with the realm. The Bishops
acquiesced with the exception of two--Pavilion of
Aleth, and Caulet of Pamiers. Pope Innocent took
their view, and upheld them against their respective
Metropolitans. Thereupon Louis XIV. summoned an
Assembly of Bishops and of selected Priests who,
without hesitation, yielded to the King's desires. The
personage selected to preach the sermon at the opening
of this Assembly was Bossuet, incomparably the
most important in this stage of French theological
thought.

The selection testifies to the general conviction.
Bossuet was highly valued alike by the King and by
the Bishops. But he had a most delicate and difficult
task before him. He must preach in a manner, if that
were possible, to conciliate the temporal power, the
episcopal power, and the papal power at Rome. He
must be true to the traditional convictions of the
Gallican Church, and yet not alienate the Gallicans
from the Papacy, nor, if possible, offend the Pope. He
must balance the temporal and spiritual power in such
a manner as to satisfy Innocent without alienating the
King. And never did Bossuet exhibit greater courage
and dexterity.[1] In his famous sermon, which was on
Unity, he described the primacy of St Peter, and the
divine selection of the one to be the centre of Unity.
He set the occupants of the Roman See very high,
but he did not hesitate to speak of occasions when
one or two of the Popes had not sustained with
sufficient constancy, or had inadequately explained the

[Footnote 1: Bossuet, t. xi. p. 588.]
-----File: p087.png--------------------------------------------------------
doctrines of the Faith.[1] He even mentioned the one
whom a Universal Council had condemned. This would
be painful to the School of Infallibility, but it was the
accepted doctrine of Catholic France. But Bossuet's
magnificent conception of twelve centuries of unity,
and his strenuous appeal to do nothing by which that
record might be broken, or that unity endangered,
must have tended greatly to conciliate and set the tone
for the subsequent discussions. So far as to his first
task--the papal power.

He was no less strong on the power of the Episcopate.
The jurisdiction bestowed on Peter was also bestowed
by Christ upon the Twelve.[2] He said the same thing
to all the Apostles.[3] Their Commission was also
immediate, direct from Christ. "One cannot imagine
a power better established nor a mission more
immediate." "It was manifestly the intention of
Jesus Christ to bestow primarily upon one that which
He ultimately willed to bestow upon many."[4] The
relation of the Pope to the Episcopate is not that he
is lord over the Bishops, but one of their number, as
says St Bernard.[5] The power of the Holy See has
nothing above it, says Bossuet, except the entire Catholic
Church.[6] In the calamitous times when the Pope claimed
the allegiance of Christendom, it was the Episcopate,
urged the preacher, which terminated the Schism and
restored the Pope. They must firmly maintain these
principles which the Gallican Church had found in the
traditions of the Universal Church; and which the
French Universities, particularly that of Paris, had
taught with the full knowledge of the Roman See.

On the relation of the temporal to the spiritual power
Bossuet said:--

"Woe to the Church when these two jurisdictions
begin to regard each other with a jealous eye.[1]
Ministers of the Church and ministers of kings are
both alike ministers of the King of kings, although
diversely established. Why do they not remember that
these functions are united, that to serve God is to serve
the State, and to serve the State is to serve God? But
authority is blind; authority ever aims at exalting itself,
at extending itself; authority considers itself degraded
when reminded of its limitations."

The Assembly ordered this sermon to be printed.
The King was satisfied with it. Bossuet had conciliated
two of the three departments, the Crown and the
Episcopate. It remained to be seen how the sermon
would be regarded at Rome. Bossuet sent the sermon
with an explanatory letter to a friendly Cardinal.

/#
"I must tell your Eminence," he wrote, "that I was
forced to speak of the liberties of the Gallican Church.
You will at once realise what that involved. I set
before myself two things--the one, to do this without
derogating from the true dignity of the Holy See; the
other, to explain the Gallican principles as the Bishops
understood them, and not as they are understood by
the magistrates."[2]...

"The sensitive ears of Romans ought to be respected.
And I have done so most readily. Three points might
wound them, namely--the temporal independence of
the royal power; episcopal jurisdiction received immediately
from Jesus Christ; and the authority of the
Councils.

"You are well aware that in France we speak plainly
on these matters, and I have endeavoured so to speak
that, without wronging the doctrine of the Gallican
Church, I might at the same time avoid offending

/#
the majesty of Rome. More than this cannot be
expected of a Gallican Bishop whom circumstances
compel to deal with points like these."[1]
#/

Bossuet's sermon, says his biographer, was received at
Rome with approval, real or affected.[2] The Assembly,
however, was less successful. Subservient to the will of
the temporal power, they made proposals which Rome
rejected. But this antagonism between the Gallican
Church and Rome led the Assembly to its reassertion
of Gallican principles, in the four famous Articles of
1682. To Bossuet was ultimately entrusted the delicate
task of formulating the Gallican belief as to the limits of
the papal power. Bossuet, representing the Church of
France, denied the doctrine of Papal Infallibility. He
believed that permanence in the truth was promised to
the Roman See as distinguished from its temporary
occupant. He maintained that although the Pope himself
might be in error, yet that error would not be
inherent in the Roman See, and would be corrected by
the Church in Council. Above the Pope was the
Universal Church. If the Roman See were in error
on the faith, it would be brought back to the truth by
the other Churches. Rome would quickly perceive
its error, and would never fall into heresy or schism.
But he denied that Infallibility could be attributed
to the occupant of the Roman See. This view was
the traditional conviction of the Church of France.
Accordingly, when the Assembly formulated its Declaration
on the limits of papal power, it expressed itself by
Bossuet's aid in the four Articles to the following effect:--

1. That the Pope could not release subjects from
obedience to the temporal power.[3]

[Footnote 1: <i>Works</i>, vol. xi. p. 292.]

[Footnote 2: Cardinal Bausset, <i>Hist. de Bossuet</i>, p. 136.]

[Footnote 3: Jervis, <i>Hist. Ch. France</i>, ii. p. 50.]
-----File: p090.png--------------------------------------------------------

2. That the Decrees of Constance on the supreme
authority of the Council remain in full force in
Christendom.

3. That the independence of the Church of France
must be maintained.

4. That the decisions of the Pope are not infallible.

/#
"The Pope has the principal place in deciding
questions of faith, and his decrees extend to every
Church and all Churches; but, nevertheless, his judgment
is not irreversible, until confirmed by the consent
of the Church."
#/

Here, then, is the essential point on the subject of
Infallibility. It resides in the Universal Church, and
not in the occupant of a particular See. As to this
doctrine, says an able French historian, there was no real
diversity of opinion in France. There existed indeed
an Ultramontane party which, countenanced by certain
powerful protectors, possessed a varying influence;[1]
but it never won the consent of the clergy in France,
which at all times showed the strongest antipathy to
Ultramontane ideas. The Declaration was signed by
thirty-four Archbishops and Bishops of the Church of
France. It experienced, says Bossuet's biographer,
himself a Cardinal of the Roman Church, no opposition
in the Kingdom.[2] It did but reaffirm a doctrine
which had been at all times dear to the University
and theological Faculty of Paris.

But if this Declaration of the Assembly was congenial
throughout France it was otherwise in Rome. "The
Pope appointed a congregation to frame a censure of
the propositions."[3] Italian writers composed attacks
upon them. One in particular was dedicated to

-----File: p091.png--------------------------------------------------------
Innocent XI., "Lord of Rome and of the World, only
Keeper of the Keys of Heaven and Earth and Paradise,
Infallible Oracle of the Faith." This provoked the
comment of Arnauld:

/#
"I pity the Holy See for possessing such defenders.
It is a terrible judgment of God upon the Church if
Rome adopts such methods of defence against the
Bishops of France."[1]
#/

Bossuet's correspondents in Rome sent him most
unfavourable reports of the probable action of the Pope.

Bossuet expressed himself very freely on the situation
in a letter to the Monastery of La Trappe:--

/#
"The affairs of the Church are in an evil plight. The
Pope openly threatens us with denunciations and even
with new Decrees. Well-intentioned mediocrity in
high places is a grave misfortune."[2]
#/

/#
"Your letter," wrote Bossuet to another correspondent,
"presents a picture of the present state of the Roman
Court which positively alarms me. Does Bellarmine
really hold the chief place there? Has he become their
tradition? Where are we if this is the case, and if the
Pope is disposed to condemn whatever that author
condemns? Hitherto they have never ventured to do
it. They have never made this attack on the Council
of Constance, nor on the Popes who have approved it.
What shall we answer heretics when they confront us
with this Council and its decrees, repeated at Basle with
the express approval of Eugenius IV., and with all the
other confirmatory acts of Rome? If Eugenius IV. did
well in his authentic approval of these decrees, how
can people attack them? And if he did wrong, what
becomes, men will ask, of his Infallibility? Shall we
have to elude these difficulties and escape the authority
of these Decrees, and of so many others both ancient

and modern, by the scholastic distinctions and miserable
subtleties of Bellarmine? Must we assert with him and
with Baronius that the Acts of the Sixth Council and
the Letters of St Leo have been falsified? Will the
Church, which has hitherto silenced heresy with solid
reasons, have no better defence than these pitiful prevarications?
May God preserve us from it."[1]
#/

Happily, says Cardinal Bausset, feeling at Rome
quieted down; and Innocent XI. was "providentially
diverted from censuring the doctrine of France. He
restricted himself to rewarding, with more generosity
than judgment, the numerous writers who attacked the
Assembly of 1682."[2] Not venturing to condemn the
four Articles, he showed his displeasure by refusing
Bulls to its members if nominated to Bishoprics.
Louis XIV. retaliated by refusing to allow any Bishop
to accept the papal Approval. This lasted through the
pontificates of Innocent XI. and Alexander VIII.
Innocent XII., says Cardinal Bausset, demanded and
obtained letters of apology from the former deputies of
the Assembly. They expressed their concern at his
resentment, but in vague and general terms capable of
various interpretations, and without any suggestion of
abandoning their traditional convictions.

But when Clement XI. attempted, on the strength
of these letters, to induce Louis XIV. to suppress
the Assembly's propositions, Louis replied that
Innocent XII. understood that his wisdom lay in not
attacking principles regarded in France as fundamental
and primitive, and held unaltered by the French Church
over many centuries. His Holiness, said the King, is
too enlightened to declare heretical what the Church

[Footnote 1: Bossuet's letter to M. Dirois.]

[Footnote 2: Bausset, <i>Hist. de Bossuet</i>, ii. p. 197.]
-----File: p093.png--------------------------------------------------------
of France maintains. "Innocent XII. did not ask me
to abandon them," added Louis. "He knew that such
a demand would be useless." And there the matter
stayed. Clement XI. acquiesced, like his predecessors,
in the independence of the Church in France from
Ultramontane opinions.

The attack on the principles of the Church of France
led Bossuet to write his greatest work--<i>The Defence
of the Declaration</i>.[1] Since the chief responsibility for
producing the Declaration had fallen upon him, it
became naturally his duty to defend it. From the
year of the Assembly onward to the end of his life,
some twenty years, he devoted an immensity of labour
to its compilation. More than once proposals were
made to publish, but reasons of State made it prudent
not to offend the Pope, and the book never appeared
during Bossuet's life. The MS. was left to Louis XIV.,
and in 1745 was printed. It is impossible in a limited
space to give an adequate idea of the character of this
monumental work. It is written in terse and vigorous
Latin. It occupies two large 8vo. volumes of some 750
pages each. Suffice it to say that the most powerful
refutation of Papal Infallibility ever published came
from the pen of the most distinguished Bishop of the
Church in France; from one who lived and died in
communion with the Roman See. Authority never
passed a censure on this work. Bossuet's Defence
powerfully influenced belief in the Church in France.
Many instances can be produced to show that it guided
and taught the teachers of that Church down to the
time of the Vatican Council itself. These volumes have
proved the storehouse whence the most telling opposition
to Ultramontanism has been derived.

Now the special interest is that this <i>Defence of the</i>

[Footnote 1: Cf. Jervis, <i>Gallican Ch.</i> ii. p. 56.]
-----File: p094.png--------------------------------------------------------
Gallican <i>Declaration</i> was never condemned at Rome.
Here is what Pope Benedict XIV., 1748, said about it:--

/#
"In the time of our immediate predecessor, Clement
XII., it was seriously debated whether this work ought
not to be proscribed; but it was finally determined
that no censure should be passed upon it. This decision
was arrived at, not only out of regard for the author's
memory, who in other respects so worthily served the
cause of religion, but also out of just apprehension of
provoking fresh dissertations and renewing the dispute."[1]
#/

A striking testimony to the powerful effect of Bossuet's
treatise when it first appeared is that of his learned
opponent, Cardinal Orsi:--

/#
"I have heard, not only at Rome, but also in many
other places, a great many persons, distinguished alike
for their character, learning, and ability, declare, after
careful study of this work of Bossuet, that the Roman
theologians had better abandon the defence of so
hopeless a cause; that it would be nobler if they would
confess it frankly, since they do not see what answer they
can make with any prospect of success to the historical
evidence which Bossuet has collected."[2]
#/

Bossuet's personal conviction on Infallibility was the
doctrine of the fourth Article of the Assembly's Declaration.
He held that it requires the consent of the Church
to make a papal decision on faith unalterable. He
declared that whatever men may assert in theory, when
it comes to practice, the final decision will inevitably
depend on the consent of the Universal Church. This,
says Cardinal Bausset, is exactly what occurs whenever
the Ultramontanes are forced within their last entrenchments.
Infallibility of the Pope ends by being only
that of the Church.[3]

[Footnote 1: Jervis, <i>Church of France</i>, ii. p. 59.]

[Footnote 2: Bausset, ii. p. 427. Orsi, <i>De irref. R. P. jud.</i> Preface t. i. d.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Ibid.</i> ii. p. 197.]
-----File: p095.png--------------------------------------------------------

Bossuet attached very little importance to objections
about the practical inconvenience of Papal Fallibility.[1]
To his mind it was perfectly futile to argue that, if
we must wait for the consent of the Church to a
pontifical decree, we should be leaving the minds
of the faithful in suspense. He considers that the
true remedy is not to extend the papal power, but to
exercise more faith in the Holy Spirit and the Catholic
Church. It is no disparagement to the Pope if the
Church be placed above him.[2]

Similarly, the <i>à priori</i> argument that submission of
the intellect must be due when the Pope defines a
doctrine, otherwise faith would vacillate; and that such
submissions can only be justified when the authority
cannot err; leaves Bossuet unmoved, except to protest
against the underlying assumption that unqualified
submission is due.

Bossuet's survey of history from the Apostolic Age to
his own time, Scripture, Fathers, Councils, Theologians,
confirmed him in the truth of the principles of the
Church in France. The ultimate and therefore irreversible
decision in faith depended on the Collective
Episcopate, and on that only; as voicing the belief of
the Universal Church.

/#
"What benefit to the Church," he exclaims in a
striking passage, "can exist in that doubtful authority,
which the Church has not yet affirmed, of a Pope's <i>ex
cathedra</i> decisions? We live in the seventeenth century
of the Catholic Church, and not yet are orthodox and
saintly men agreed about that Infallibility. To say
nothing of the Councils of Constance and of Basle,
saintly and learned men are opposed to it. And if
many private individuals clamour greatly, and pour
forth imprudent censures against them, yet neither the
Catholic Church nor Rome itself passes any condemna-*

[Footnote 1: Bossuet, i. p. 112.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> i. p. 113.]

/#
*tion upon them. Three hundred years we have controverted
it with impunity. Has the Church waited for
peace and security down to this our age, until the
seventeenth century is almost at an end? Plainly,
then, the security of pious souls must rest in the
consent of the Universal Church. It cannot be that
they should acquiesce in the doubtful Infallibility of
the Roman Pontiff.... A doubtful Infallibility is not
that Infallibility which Christ bestowed. If He had
granted it at all He would have revealed it to His
Church from the very beginning. He would not have
left it doubtful, inadequately revealed, nor useless for
want of an indisputable tradition."[1]
#/

What made the Pope's advocacy of Ultramontane
ideas additionally distressing to Bossuet and others
was that in their presentation of Catholic Truth to
Protestants no mention whatever had been made of
Papal Infallibility as pertaining in any way to Catholic
principles. In Bossuet's famous <i>Exposition de la Doctrine
Catholique</i>, written expressly to explain the fundamental
Catholic Dogmas to men of other Communions, he
had spoken of "the authority of the Holy See and of
the Episcopate," thus acknowledging a double power.[2]
He said that it was not necessary to speak of matters
disputed in the theological schools because they formed
no part in the Catholic Faith. And this Exposition
was published with papal approbation.[3] It had been
singularly effective in commending the Roman Church
to its opponents, and in gaining their submission. But
if it was known that the Pope resented these principles,
still more, if he openly ventured to condemn them as
errors approximate to heresy, Protestant converts could
hardly fail to retort: We submitted to the Church on
the distinct assertion that no Catholic was required to

[Footnote 3: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 104.]

believe either in the Infallibility of the Pope or in his
right to depose kings.[1] In that case we have been
misguided and deceived. It is, exclaimed thoughtful
French Catholics looking across to England, precisely
these doctrines which are the principal cause of the
persecution of Catholics there.[2]

The publication of Bossuet's great work in 1745
may have given considerable strength to Catholicism
in France of an Anti-Roman type; but other treatises
show that the clergy of France were being persistently
trained in similar ideas. The theological principles
inculcated with the authority of the Archbishop of
Lyons in 1784 in the seminaries of his diocese include
the following propositions: The Roman Pontiff even
when speaking <i>ex cathedra</i>, in matters of faith and
morals, can be deceived; Bishops possess jurisdiction
direct from Christ and not from the Roman Pontiff;
the authority of the Roman Pontiff is inferior to that
of a General Council. The principles taught at the
same period in the diocese of Rouen were similar.[3]

CHAPTER X

OPPOSITION AMONG ROMAN CATHOLICS IN ENGLAND


The struggle of Catholic <i>versus</i> Ultramontane in the
Roman Communion in England finds forcible expression
in the famous letter of the distinguished Roman
Catholic layman, Sir John Throgmorton, in 1790:--

/#
"He laid stress," says a Roman writer, "on the fact
that ever since the day of Pius V.'s excommunication
of Elizabeth, 'the English Catholics have been divided
into two parties. The "Papistic" party, on the one
hand, upheld and maintained all the pretensions of the
Court of Rome, and were supported by all the influence
of that Court, sometimes by briefs from the Popes
themselves.... The other party consisted and still
consists of the descendants of the old Catholic families,
and a respectable portion of the clergy who, true to the
religion of their ancestors, have uniformly ... protested
against the usurped authority of the Court of Rome.'
He denied that the original cause of the difference--the
question whether or no the Pope had the power
to depose sovereigns--represented adequately the distinction
between the two parties. The deposing power
was no longer maintained by any one; but the
'Papistic' party still remained, and taught the Infallibility
of the Pope and urged all his claims. He called
on English Catholics to dissociate themselves from this
party and its teaching."[1]
#/

[Footnote 1: Quoted in W. Ward's <i>Life of Wiseman</i>, i. p. 513.]
-----File: p099.png--------------------------------------------------------

The London Romanist clergy selected a Bishop of
Catholic as opposed to Ultramontane convictions.
Rome refused, however, to accept their selection, and
the English Catholics submitted. Here is an illustration
of the method by which the older principles were to be
suppressed.[1] Nevertheless the older principles remained.
The Roman body in England continued to maintain its
anti-Roman ideas. This appears incontestably in their
appeal to Parliament for removal of their political disabilities,
under which they had suffered terribly since
the days of Elizabeth. These political disabilities were
the Nemesis of the unfortunate action of the Papacy
against Queen Elizabeth, and of the theories on the
relation between spiritual and temporal power advocated
by Roman writers of that period. The penal laws
against the Roman Communion in England were the
product of fear, being in design defensive against political
results of Roman teaching. However, in course of time,
none too soon, nobler and juster counsels began to prevail,
and the time approached when all the impartial
desired the removal of restrictions and penalties which
were formed on principles of brutality and retaliation
happily growing obsolete. But to secure the removal of
penal legislation, it was necessary for the Romanists in
England to reassure the public opinion that they were
not bound by theories from Rome irreconcilable with
English loyalty.

When accordingly in the year 1788 a Committee
of English Romanists was formed to appeal to Parliament
for the removal of Roman disabilities,[2] the
petitioners declared that it was a duty which they
owed to their country, as well as themselves, to protest
in a formal and solemn manner against doctrines which

[Footnote 1: Quoted in W. Ward's <i>Life of Wiseman</i>, i. p. 515.]

[Footnote 2: <i>See</i> Butler, <i>Historical Memoirs of the English Catholics</i>, vol. ii. p. 115ff.]
-----File: p100.png--------------------------------------------------------
constituted no part of their principles, religion, or belief.[1]
Among these they rejected the theory that excommunicated
princes may be deposed or murdered by
their subjects. They declared that no ecclesiastical
power whatever can absolve subjects from allegiance to
lawful temporal authority.[2] They wrote: "We believe
that no act that is in itself immoral or dishonest can
ever be justified by or under colour that it is done
either for the good of the Church or in obedience to
any ecclesiastical power whatever."[3] And--what now
particularly concerns us here--they said: "We acknowledge
no Infallibility in the Pope."

This protestation of the Roman Catholics of England
brought about the passing of the Relief Act of 1791.
The representative character of the document may be
realised from the fact that it was signed by all the
four Vicars Apostolic; that is by all the highest
Roman authorities in England, by 240 priests; and
in all by 1,523 members of the Anglo-Roman body,
among whom most of the educated and influential
laity were included. It would be interesting to
ascertain what proportion the 240 priests bore to the
total number of Roman clergy in this land. Accurate
statistics are not easily obtained. The Committee of
English Romanists claimed that the total number
of Roman priests in England did not exceed 260.
Berington, in 1780, estimated the number as nearer
360, of whom 110 were ex-Jesuits. From these figures
it would appear that, if the Jesuits are left out, nearly
the whole body of Roman Clergy in England, including
their four Bishops, committed themselves frankly to
rejection of Papal Infallibility.[4]

[Footnote 1: See Butler, <i>Historical Memoirs of the English Catholics</i>, vol. ii. p. 117.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 118.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 119.]

[Footnote 4: Bernard Ward, <i>Dawn of the Catholic Revival</i>, i. p. 151.]
-----File: p101.png--------------------------------------------------------

Dr Milner describes it, indeed, as "drawn up in
ungrammatical language, with inconclusive reasoning
and erroneous theology."[1] And a vicar apostolic who
first signed it afterwards withdrew his signature.[2] On
the other hand, an influential section of the Communion
placed the document in the British Museum, "that it
may be preserved there as a lasting memorial of their
political and moral integrity."[3]

The history of Irish Roman belief is similar. An Act
for their relief was passed in 1793. It contains an oath
which states that "it is not an article of the Catholic
Faith, neither am I thereby required to believe or profess
that the Pope is infallible."[4]

In an address to Protestants of the United Empire in
1813 by a Roman Catholic writer (Charles Butler), anti-Roman
prejudice is reassured by the terms of the oath
taken by Irish Roman Catholics:[5] "In the oath taken
by the Irish Roman Catholics they swear that 'it is not
an article of the Catholic faith, and that they are not
thereby bound to believe or profess that the Pope
is infallible.'"[6]

No less unmistakable is the language of a Roman
Catholic Bishop in England in 1822:--

/#
"Bellarmine and some other divines, chiefly Italians,
have believed the Pope infallible, when proposing <i>ex
cathedra</i> an article of faith. But in England or Ireland
I do not believe that any Catholic maintains the Infallibility
of the Pope."[7]
#/

The Pastoral Address of the Irish Bishops to their
clergy and laity in 1826 declared that it is "not an

-----File: p102.png--------------------------------------------------------
article of the Catholic faith, neither are they thereby
required to believe that the Pope is infallible."[1]

Accordingly, a Roman Catholic nobleman, Lord
Clifford, writing to reassure the English peers on the
Maynooth Endowment Bill, could say in 1845: "It
is not an article of Catholic faith that the Pope is
infallible even in matters of faith."[2]

There is not the slightest reason to doubt the sincerity
of the Romanist statements. They were not misrepresenting
their convictions to improve their circumstances.
They genuinely believed these principles. They claimed
as Catholics an independence from Romanising views.

When Dr Wiseman (afterwards Cardinal) was nominated
by the Pope to the London District in 1847,
nearly all the clergy, says Wilfred Ward, "were
sufficiently imbued by the conservative and national
spirit to be opposed to his energetic scheme of reform."[3]
They viewed with distaste his "Romanising" proclivities.
Trained in the College in Rome, having spent years
under the Pope's immediate direction, Wiseman returned
to England bent on propagating that "papistic spirit"
against which the older English Roman Catholics, as
represented by Sir John Throgmorton, had so vigorously
protested.[4] The introduction of the Jesuit and other
religious Orders was Wiseman's work, and it was repugnant
to the temper and prejudices of the old
Romanist families in England. But Rome approved, and
Wiseman persisted. Then came the re-establishment
of the Roman Hierarchy in England, the elevation of
Wiseman to the Cardinalate, and his return to England
as Archbishop of Westminster. Then the Tractarian
movement gave new life to the Anglican Church; but

[Footnote 4: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 512.]
-----File: p103.png--------------------------------------------------------
it also contributed new distinction and new strength to
the Roman Communion. Converts like Faber threw
themselves, with the convert's proverbial intensity, into
the most extreme of Roman devotions, legends, and
principles; much to the amazement and disgust of the
old-fashioned Romans, who found themselves regarded
with coldness and indifference, as half-Catholic, at
Rome, while the zealous converted extremists basked
in the sunshine of Rome's approval. There is no little
irony in the situation. The Vicar Apostolic of the
London district warned Newman on his conversion
against "books of devotion of the Italian School."[1]
Faber reproduced the most Italianised lives of the
saints. Bishop Ullathorne of Birmingham, himself of
old Roman family, considered these Italian compositions
unsuited to this country. Newman, as Superior of the
Oratory, wrote to Faber, describing them as "unsuited
to England and unacceptable to Protestants."[2] Accordingly
the publications ceased. But Wiseman's exertions
to promote Ultramontanism within the Roman Communion
continued, and were most successful. Here is
a letter of approval written to the Cardinal from
influential quarters in Rome:--

/#
"I can say that you have been the instrument under
God, to <i>Romanise</i> England.... You have been able
to change the whole feeling of the rising clergy, and
to instil into the laity what Roman principles they
possess."[3]

But if Wiseman "changed the feeling of the rising
clergy," this was not done without desperate struggles
on the part of the older clergy. Wiseman, whose
insight into human nature was of the scantiest, chose

[Footnote 3: 1859.]
-----File: p104.png--------------------------------------------------------
as his coadjutor, with the right of succession, Bishop
Errington. Errington belonged to the older school.
The Chapter of Westminster agreed with him. Accordingly
Wiseman found himself opposed by the Chapter,
with the Coadjutor-Bishop as their leader. The contest
which followed was, says Wilfred Ward, "the turning
point in the controversy between the conservative
policy and that of the new Ultramontanism."[1] It
was no merely personal struggle, but a struggle of
principles. On the other side, Wiseman pushed forward
Manning, whom the Pope sent from Rome and placed
as Provost over the entire Chapter of Westminster.

Into the details of the struggle we cannot go. But
Errington and Manning fought for opposing principles.
Manning, says Wilfred Ward, with his "fixed ideas and
firm determination."[2] As to Errington: "iron determination
and persistency were stamped on face and
figure." "Both men of strong will with utterly opposite
ideals and aims."[3] Errington had none of the tactful
discretion of the diplomatist in his constitution, and
was no match for the subtlety of Manning. And
ultimately, on Wiseman's appeal to Rome, Errington
was removed by the Pope from the position of Coadjutor,
and lost his right of succession to the Archbishopric of
Westminster. The main charge against him was that
he was anti-Roman in sympathies.[4] Great was the
rejoicing among the Ultramontanes at this victory.
The succession of Bishop Errington was their greatest
fear.

"I cannot conceive a greater misfortune," wrote a high
authority from Rome to Cardinal Wiseman, "than your
being followed by Dr Errington, who, I feel certain, if
he ever become Archbishop of Westminster, will do all

he can to undo what has been done, and will be a
constant source of annoyance to the Holy See."[1]
#/

Father Faber wrote in similar strains:--

/#
"If [Dr Errington] returns to Westminster as Archbishop,
the Holy See will have to reckon that it will
take fifty, if not a hundred, years to restore England
to the pitch of Ultramontanism which she has now
reached."[2]
#/

On Wiseman's death the older Catholic party made
one more struggle for supremacy. The Chapter of
Westminster, notwithstanding that Manning presided,
longed for a Bishop of the older school. Accordingly,
their then selected candidates were Bishop
Errington, Bishop Grant, and Bishop Clifford. The
insertion of Errington's name was considered by the
Pope as a personal insult. In the interests of their own
aims it was certainly unwise; for it rendered the Pope
disinclined to listen to any of the Chapter's suggestions.[3]
As for Bishop Clifford, Manning denounced him in a
private letter to Rome as a worldly Catholic, <i>i.e.</i>
opposed to the Ultramontanes; and he sided against
Infallibility afterwards in the Vatican Council. As for
Bishop Grant, Manning wrote:--

/#
"I cannot for a moment even fear that the Holy See
would accept any one of these names. I wish," added
Manning, conscious of the critical nature of the struggle
for the future of Ultramontanism in England, "I wish
that the Holy Father would reserve the Archbishopric
in perpetuity to the Holy See. For it is perfectly
certain that whoever comes, it is a question of a change
of policy. It is Tories out and Whigs in, with all the
consequences."[4]

[Footnote 4: <i>Ibid.</i>]
-----File: p106.png--------------------------------------------------------

Manning's prophetic instinct proved correct. Pius IX.
paused, reflected, took advice, and ultimately, not however
without considerable misgivings, set aside all three
of the Chapter's nominations, and on his own authority
appointed Manning.[1] Now Manning led the English
Ultramontanes in the Council of the Vatican.

But the task of Romanising the English Catholics
was no easy thing. The <i>literature</i> of the Roman
Communion in England and Ireland during the
eighteenth and early nineteenth century shows how
thoroughly saturated they were with Catholic as contrasted
with Ultramontane convictions. It is difficult to
obtain that literature in its genuine and original form
to-day; for of course all works reprinted since 1870
have been altered into conformity with Vatican ideas.
In some cases the process of reducing to conformity
was begun at an earlier date. It is therefore with
works printed before 1870 that we are now concerned.

1. For example, in the well-known Roman manual of
theology by Berrington and Kirk, entitled the <i>Faith of
Catholics</i>, confirmed by Scripture, and attested by the
Fathers of the first five centuries--with St Vincent's
maxim on the title-page ("that which has been believed
always everywhere," etc.)--we find the following
teaching on Infallibility:--

/#
"It is no article of Catholic Faith to believe that the
Pope is himself infallible, separated from the Church,
even in expounding the Faith: by consequence, Papal
definitions or decrees, in whatever form pronounced,
taken exclusively from a General Council or acceptance
of the Church, oblige no one under pain of heresy to an
interior assent."[2]
#/

This teaching, found in the edition of 1830, now
disappears.

[Footnote 1: 1865.]

[Footnote 2: Page 165.]
-----File: p107.png--------------------------------------------------------

2. Delahogue was Professor in Dublin where his theological
works were published in several volumes in
1829. The type of instruction then given in an Irish
seminary to students of Roman theology may be
understood from the fact that Delahogue asserts that
the doctrine that the Roman Pontiff, even when he
speaks <i>ex cathedra</i>, is possessed of the gift of inerrancy
or is superior to General Councils may be denied
without loss of faith or risk of heresy or schism.

To justify this position appeal is made among others
to Cardinal Perron who, although himself a supporter
of the doctrine of papal inerrancy, assured King
James I. that the question was not a hindrance to
Ecclesiastical Reunion; since whichever view his
Majesty might adopt he would none the less on either
side be recognised as Catholic.

Delahogue appealed also to the fact that no reference
to Papal Infallibility occurs in the Creed of Pius IV.
Bossuet's famous exposition affirmed that matters disputed
in the schools of theology, and invidiously
brought forward by Calvinistic doctors, were no part
of the Catholic Faith; and Bossuet's Exposition was
endorsed by a brief of Innocent XI. Delahogue also
pointed out that inferences from the figurative comparison
of the relation between the Pope and the
Church to that between the human head and body
must be drawn with discretion. The effect of decapitation
upon the human body differs from that of the
death of a Pope upon the Church. Indeed the latter
is essentially the same in spite of a long interregnum,
or a schism, or a doubtful succession of forty years.
Similarly, it does not follow that an <i>ex cathedra</i>
fallacious utterance would be the Church's ruin.

3. De Lisle, who was received into the Roman Communion
at the age of fifteen, in 1825, was moulded in
-----File: p108.png--------------------------------------------------------
the Roman convictions as held in England at that date.
Forty years later he recorded his faith in the following
words:--

/#
"We are far from claiming for the Papacy any separate
Infallibility distinct from that which all Catholics are
bound to believe in, as the prerogative of the <i>Universal
Church</i>. Those who make so novel a claim must
reconcile it with the grave facts of ecclesiastical
history.... And we believe that with those facts
undenied and not disproved it would be impossible for
the Church to define any such theories to be articles of
faith."[1]
#/

The following year De Lisle repeated his convictions
on Infallibility in a letter to Father Ryder, afterwards
Superior of the Birmingham Oratory.

/#
"I will tell you my own belief, as to that attribute
of Holy Church, which a learned Bishop pronounced
accurate and orthodox. First of all, I believe Infallibility
to be a <i>conjunctive</i> and <i>collective</i> attribute of the <i>whole
Catholic Church</i> according to the words of Holy Church in
her Collect, 'God by whose Spirit the whole body of the
Church is governed and sanctified.' In other words, the
infallible assistance of the Holy Spirit is given to the
whole Church in its collective capacity, to the Laity
as well as the Clergy. To the latter especially in their
collective capacity as the teachers. To the former as
the recipients of that teaching, giving them an instinctive
apprehension of what is or is not in conformity with
the traditional teaching of the Church. Now in this
view of the matter, no one, whether pastor or layman,
has any <i>separate personal</i> gift of the infallible guidance
of the Holy Spirit, but it is given to all collectively
in order to enable them <i>safely to keep</i> and <i>rightly to
apprehend</i> the Deposit of Faith.... Now it follows
from my view that all Catholics--from the Pope down-*wards
to the meanest baptized layman--all are under
#/

[Footnote 1: Ambrose Lisle Phillipps, <i>Union Review</i>, May 1866, p. 95.]
-----File: p109.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
the infallible guidance of the Holy Spirit, as long as
all, in their respective positions, whether as Teachers
or Believers, are acting and believing according to the
unchangeable Deposit, for the preservation and right
understanding of which the power of <i>binding and loosing</i>
and of <i>feeding</i> the whole flock has been conferred upon
the supreme Pastor."[1]
#/

4. Milner's <i>End of Religious Controversy</i> was written to
explain the Roman tenets to Protestants and to remove
misapprehensions.[2]

/#
"When any fresh controversy arises in the Church,
the fundamental maxim of the Bishops and Popes to
whom it belongs to decide upon it, is, not to consult
their own private opinion or interpretation of Scripture
but to enquire <i>what is and ever has been the doctrine of
the Church</i> concerning it. Hence their cry is and ever
has been on such occasions, as well in her Councils as
out of them: <i>So we have received; so the Universal
Church believes: let there be no new doctrine; none but
what has been delivered down to us by Tradition</i>.
The Infallibility, then, of our Church is not a power
of telling all things past, present, and to come, such
as Pagans ascribed to their oracles; but merely the
aid of God's Holy Spirit to enable her truly to decide
what her faith is and has ever been, in such articles
as have been made known to her by Scripture and
tradition. This definition furnishes answer to divers
other objections and questions.... The Church does
not decide the controversy concerning the Conception
of the Blessed Virgin, and several other disputed points,
because she sees nothing absolutely clear and certain
concerning them, either in the written or the unwritten
word, and therefore leaves her children to form their
own opinions concerning them. Finally his Lordship,
with other controversialists, objects against the Infallibility
of the Catholic Church, that its advocates are
not agreed where to lodge this prerogative, some

[Footnote 1: 1867. De Lisle, <i>Life</i>, ii. pp. 36, 37.]

-----File: p110.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
ascribing it to the Pope, others to a General Council,
or to the Bishops dispersed throughout the Church.
True, schoolmen discuss some such points; but let
me ask his Lordship whether he finds any Catholic
who denies or doubts that a General Council, with
the Pope at its head, or that the Pope himself, issuing
a doctrinal decision which is received by the great
body of Catholic Bishops, is secure from error? Most
certainly not, and hence he may gather where all
Catholics agree in lodging Infallibility."
#/

Milner's view of Catholicism is that if we would
know what is of faith, we must ask what is and ever
has been the doctrine of the Church. A dogma cannot
be something new. It must be what has been universally
believed from the beginning. Tried by this test, he
finds that the Immaculate Conception is an opinion, not
a doctrine of the Church; that individuals are free to
form their own opinion concerning it, because there
was nothing absolutely clear and certain about it either
in the written or the unwritten word; that Papal
Infallibility was a matter of scholastic discussion, a
theory of theologians, but that the Infallibility of the
Church was a matter which no Catholic doubted.

5. Gallitzin's rejection of Papal Infallibility is even
more emphatic.

/#
"Although I have plainly told the Protestant minister
that the Infallibility of the Pope is no part of the
Catholic Creed, a mere opinion of some divines, an
article nowhere to be found in our professions of faith,
in our creeds, in our catechisms, etc., yet the Protestant
minister most ungenerously and uncandidly brings it
forward, over and over again, as an article of the
Catholic faith; and takes his opportunity from this
forgery of his own to abuse the Catholic Church."[1]
#/

[Footnote 1: Gallitzin, <i>Defence of Catholic Principles</i>. See <i>Papal Infallibility</i>, by a
Roman Catholic layman, 1876, p. 16.]
-----File: p111.png--------------------------------------------------------

6. Another exposition of the Roman faith for English-speaking
people is the famous book called <i>Keenan's
Catechism</i>. It is entitled <i>Controversial Catechism, or
Protestantism Refuted and Catholicism Established</i>.
The edition of 1860 is described as the third edition,
and in its seventeenth thousand. It bears the imprimatur
of four Roman Bishops, two of them being
Vicars Apostolic. In these approbations we are assured
that "the sincere searcher after truth will here find a
lucid path opened to conduct him to its sanctuary;
while the believer will be hereby instructed and confirmed
in his faith." From 1846 to 1860 it was being
largely circulated throughout England, Scotland, and
Ireland.

The book contains the following question and
answer:--

/#
"(<i>Q.</i>) Must not Catholics believe the Pope in himself
to be infallible?

(<i>A.</i>) This is a Protestant invention: it is no article
of the Catholic faith: no decision of his can oblige
under pain of heresy, unless it be received and enforced
by the teaching body, that is by the bishops of the
Church."
#/

<i>Keenan's Catechism</i> has since 1870 appeared with
alterations. The new edition is, as the preface justly
remarks, "more than a mere reprint." As issued in
1896, it rightly styles itself a "revised edition." The
question and answer just quoted have of course now
disappeared. They are replaced by a series of ten
enquiries, with answers giving exactly the contrary
doctrine. The first of these runs as follows:--

/*
"(<i>Q.</i>) What do Catholics believe concerning the
Infallibility of the Pope?

(<i>A.</i>) That the visible Head of the Church on earth
received from Christ the same prerogative of Infalli-*
*/
-----File: p112.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
*bility which we have shown above to be necessary
to and belong to the Church by divine institution."[1]
#/

Thus what was formerly denounced as a Protestant
invention is now affirmed as a Catholic truth.

The earlier revisers of <i>Keenan's Catechism</i> contented
themselves with quiet substitution of the new doctrine
for the old without further explanation. But the later
revisers have felt that something more was necessary
to justify the change. Accordingly they inserted the
following:--

/#
"(<i>Q.</i>) But some Catholics before the Vatican Council
denied the Infallibility of the Pope, which was also
formerly impugned in this very Catechism.

(<i>A.</i>) Yes; but they did so under the usual reservation--'in
so far as they then could grasp the mind of the
Church, and subject to her future definitions'--thus
<i>implicitly</i> accepting the dogma; had they been prepared
to maintain their own opinion contumaciously
in such case they would have been Catholics only in
name."
#/

That is to say, that teaching endorsed by Catholic
Bishops is delivered under the reservation that the
opposite may be true; that this is the usual reservation,
applicable therefore to all Episcopal teaching;
that no certainty exists in the Roman Communion
whether instruction now being given as Catholic may
not be upset and reversed by some future definition;
(in which case what is its authoritative value and its
relation to truth?) and that the Roman Bishops who
endorsed Keenan's first edition implicitly accepted the
dogma which they explicitly denied. I am most
anxious not to exaggerate. But this seems an
intellectual and a moral confusion. There is something
wrong with a cause which requires such a defence.

[Footnote 1: Page 111.]
-----File: p113.png--------------------------------------------------------
But this is not all. For the revised edition goes on to
enquire, "Were there any other dogmas defined by the
Church which had been controverted before decision?"
This is answered in the affirmative. "Nearly every
definition of dogma by the Church had been preceded
by a period of controversy, in which theologians ranked
themselves on different sides." Then the question is
asked:--

/#
"(<i>Q.</i>) Can you name any Controversies on fundamental
dogma on which the Church pronounced in the same
way as she did on Papal Infallibility at the Vatican
Council?

(<i>A.</i>) Yes. The Divinity of Christ was not formally
defined till the first Council of Nicæa (325)."
#/

Some other instances having been given, we then reach
the Question--

/#
"(<i>Q.</i>) What do you conclude from these observations?

(<i>A.</i>) That the definition of the Infallibility of the
Pope as a dogma of primitive Christian Revelation has
historically run a course similar to the definition of
many other fundamental articles of the Catholic Faith."
#/

The implications of this assertion are worth considering.
A parallel is drawn between the attitude of
Catholics towards the two doctrines of Papal Infallibility
and of the Divinity of Jesus Christ. They have
historically, it is said, run a similar course. Now we
ask just this: Were those Bishops who endorsed
<i>Keenan's Catechism</i> Catholics or not? There is only
one possible reply: Yes, they were. They lived and
died in the Communion of the Roman Church. It
was then possible to be a Catholic before 1870 and
yet deny this doctrine of Papal Infallibility. But was
it ever possible to be a Catholic while denying the
other doctrine, the Divinity of Jesus Christ? There
is only one answer that can be given. Assuredly it
-----File: p114.png--------------------------------------------------------
was not. Explicit denial of the Divinity of our Lord
must indisputably <i>ipso facto</i> exclude from Catholicity,
and must have had this effect at any stage in the
development of Christendom. Consequently the parallel
between the course which these two doctrines have
historically pursued is simply misleading and untrue.
Indeed the assertion grievously misrepresents the
evidence. A real parallel would require that as the
doctrine of Papal Infallibility was disputed by Roman
Catholics for many hundreds of years, and openly
described as a mere opinion of the Schools which might
be taken or left without detriment to Catholicity--indeed
controversially deprecated as an invention of opponents,
ungenerously and uncandidly ascribed to the Catholic
Church, while its acceptance and rejection were both
tolerated by the Church itself--similar experience
awaited the doctrine of the Divinity of Christ. But
not one iota of this holds good with the Divinity of
Christ. Our Lord's Divinity was never disputed by
Catholics, never openly described as a mere opinion
of the schools; its rejection never was or could be
tolerated by the Church for a single hour. No doubt
there were imperfect expressions in the ante-Nicene
period, but there was no silence on this doctrine in
the primitive Church. The Arian was not an implicit
Catholic, inwardly prepared to accept what he outwardly
denied. Nor would he have been grateful for this
explanation of his attitude. He never was a Catholic
at all. Moreover, if the character of the two doctrines
be considered, it is inevitable to ask whether the doctrine
of Papal Infallibility is fundamental in the Christian
Faith. If it be fundamental after the Church has
defined it, it was fundamental before the definition.
A doctrine does not become fundamental through the
Church's definition, but through its own intrinsic char-*
-----File: p115.png--------------------------------------------------------
*acter. It therefore remains unaccounted for that a fundamental
of the Christian Faith should be described as a
Protestant invention, and such description sanctioned
by Catholic Bishops, and tolerated by Rome.

It is really incredible that a critically or historically
trained intellect could venture on so daring and unhistoric
a parallel. Such uncritical defence not only
fails to secure its design, but suggests an insecurity
in the Church's belief in the Divinity of her Lord.
Such defence is necessitated by the school which is
constrained to condemn what it previously taught, and
to teach what it once condemned; but the necessity for
such defence betrays the character of the doctrine which
requires it.

The historical evidence, which might be considerably
increased, shows that English Romanists in general did
not hold Papal Infallibility even as a private opinion;
that, on the contrary, they maintained principles by
which that opinion is excluded; that they believed
in the Infallibility of the Church, but placed that Infallibility
in the Collective Episcopate whether assembled
or dispersed.

7. Even in the great College of Maynooth itself an
Irish Roman Catholic Professor could publish as late
as 1861 such words as these:--

/#
"That the Universal Church is infallible in its belief
and profession of faith, that the body of pastors is
infallible in teaching, are two dogmas of Catholic faith.
That the Infallibility of the Chief Pontiff is a revealed
truth, and therefore definable, as of Catholic faith, is to
me personally perfectly clear. Nevertheless, since it
belongs to the Church alone to determine what is
essential to belief, and since that dogma has never yet
been in that manner proposed to be believed, they who
genuinely hold the contrary are by no means or only
#/
-----File: p116.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
in the least degree (unless indeed some other ground be
shown) to be considered alien from the Catholic Faith."[1]
#/

Here we have striking indications of a change. The
Ultramontane influence is recognised, although not
submitted to; Papal Infallibility is acknowledged as a
private opinion of the teacher, but the contrary opinion
is, with reserve, recognised to be legitimate. This utterance
from Maynooth becomes more intelligible when
it is remembered that Cardinal Cullen, trained in Rome
and nominated Primate of Ireland by Pius IX., was now
presiding over that Communion in Dublin. Cullen,
says Ollivier, responded admirably to the confidence
which Pius IX. placed in him.[2]

/#
"The Romanised Cullen," says another, "whom the
Pope forced as Primate on the Irish Bishops, with the
same view as he imposed Manning on the English
Bishops, is of course an Infallibilist."[3]
#/

<i>Journalism</i> in England took no unimportant part in
the struggle between Catholic and Ultramontane. That
most paradoxical extremist, the convert Ward, was
appointed by Wiseman in 1862 editor of the <i>Dublin
Review</i>.[4] Ward's ideal in his Roman days was spiritual
dictatorship of the most absolute character.[5] He said
he wanted pontifical decrees every morning for breakfast
with his newspaper. And Manning encouraged
him. Manning shut his eyes to Ward's exaggerations
and rejoiced in his uncompromising tone.

/#
"What we need," he wrote, "is incisive assertion of
the loftiest truths. I am persuaded that boldness is
prudence, and that our danger lies in half truths."[6]
#/

[Footnote 5: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 343.]

[Footnote 6: <i>Ibid.</i>]
-----File: p117.png--------------------------------------------------------

So blessed and sanctioned, Ward went straight ahead.
The Ultramontanism of the <i>Dublin Review</i> must have
been gall and bitterness to the old-fashioned English
Romanist.

While Ward and the <i>Dublin Review</i>, supported by
Manning, pushed papal absolutism to the furthest
extremes, Lord Acton and the series of journals with
which he was connected, such as the <i>Rambler</i> and the
short-lived but brilliant <i>Home and Foreign Review</i>,
recalled the Catholic mind to the facts of History.
Abbot Gasquet's estimate of the <i>Dublin Review</i> and
the <i>Rambler</i> is significant.

/#
"The <i>Dublin Review</i> and the <i>Rambler</i> were conducted
upon lines wholly divergent. In historical matters the
policy of the <i>Dublin Review</i> appears to have been to
avoid as far as possible facing unpleasant facts in the
past, and to explain away, if it could not directly deny,
the existence of blots in the ecclesiastical annals of the
older centuries. The <i>Rambler</i>, on the other hand, held
the view that the Church had nothing to lose and much
to gain by meeting facts as they were."[1]
#/

The refusal to face the facts, the resolve to manipulate
them in the interests of edification, was characteristic
of an extensive controversial school of which the <i>Dublin
Review</i> was a vigorous and extreme exponent. It was
done deliberately, on principle, prompted by a profound
distrust of history. Lord Acton's criticisms[2] on this
uncritical method of advancing truth are inimitable.

/#
"A particular suspicion rested on history, because, as
the study of facts, it was less amenable to authority and
less controlled by interest than philosophical speculation.
In consequence partly of the denial of historical
certainty, and partly of the fear of it, the historical study
#/

[Footnote 1: Gasquet, <i>Lord Acton and his Circle</i>, p. xxxix.]

[Footnote 2: "Ultramontanism," <i>Home and Foreign Review</i>, iii. p. 173, 1863.]
-----File: p118.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
of dogma in its original sources was abandoned, and the
dialectical systematic treatment preferred."[1]

As to the treatment of History: "First, it was held,
the interests of religion, which are opposed to the study
of history, require that precautions should be taken to
make it innocuous where it cannot be quite suppressed.
If it is lawful to conceal facts or statements, it is equally
right to take out their sting when they must be brought
forward. It is not truth, but error, which is suppressed
by this process, the object of which is to prevent a false
impression being made on the minds of men. For the
effect of those facts or statements is to prejudice men
against the Church, and to lead them to false conclusions
concerning her nature. Whatever tends to
weaken this adverse impression contributes really to
baffle a falsehood and sustain the cause of truth. The
statement, however true in its own subordinate place,
will only seem to mislead in a higher order of truth,
where the consequences may be fatal to the conscience
and happiness of those who hear it without any qualification.
Words, moreover, often convey to the uninstructed
mind ideas contrary to their real significance, and the
interpretation of facts is yet more delusive.... For
the object is not the discovery of objective truth, but
the production of a right belief in a particular mind....
It is the duty of the son to cover the shame of his
father; and the Catholic owes it to the Church to
defend her against every adverse fact as he would
defend the honour of his mother. He will not coldly
examine the value of testimony, or concede any point
because it is hard to meet, or assist with unbiassed
mind in the discovery of truth before he learns what
its bearing may be. Assured that nothing injurious
to the Church can be true, he will combat whatever
bears an unfavourable semblance with every attainable

An Anglican writer has given us a terse expression of
the same idea: The Deity, we are told, cannot alter
the past. But the ecclesiastical historian can and
does.[1]

With all the instinct of self-preservation, the Ultramontane
mistrusted and resented the historical School.
Cardinal Wiseman wrote in a Pastoral[2] a severe
denunciation of the journal which Acton edited. To
the Cardinal, the <i>Home and Foreign Review</i> seemed
characterised by "the absence for years of all reserve
and reverence in its treatment of persons or of things
deemed sacred." He wrote with great severity on what
appeared to him its "habitual preference of uncatholic
to Catholic instincts, tendencies, and motives."

Acton[3] admitted in his reply that "a very formidable
mass of ecclesiastical authority and popular feeling
was united against certain principles or opinions which,
whether rightly or wrongly, are attributed to us." He
then proceeded to give an account of the principles
which ought to govern the attitude of Catholics towards
modern discoveries.

/#
"A political law or a scientific truth may be perilous
to the morals or the faith of individuals, but it cannot
on this ground be resisted by the Church. It may at
times be a duty of the State to protect freedom of
conscience, yet this freedom may be a temptation to
apostasy. A discovery may be made in science which
will shake the faith of thousands, yet religion cannot
refute it or object to it. The difference in this respect
between a true and a false religion is, that one judges
all things by the standard of their truth, the other
by the touchstone of its own interests."[4]

-----File: p120.png--------------------------------------------------------

And this led Acton to pronounce a severe criticism
on methods of defence prevalent in the Roman Catholic
Church of the day. He said that in reaction from
the unscrupulous attacks of the eighteenth century,
a school of apologists had arisen dominated by the
opinion that nothing said against the Church could
be true. Their only object was defence. "They were
often careless in statement, rhetorical and illogical in
argument, too positive to be critical and too confident
to be precise." "In this school," he continues, "the
present generation of Catholics was educated." And
he complains that "the very qualities which we condemn
in our opponents, as the natural defences of error, and
the significant emblems of a bad cause, came to taint
both our literature and our policy." Meanwhile, learning
had passed on beyond the vision of such apologists, and
the apologists have, so far as effectiveness is concerned,
collapsed before it.

/#
"Investigations have become so impersonal, so colour-*less,
so free from the prepossessions which distort truth,
from predetermined aims and foregone conclusions, that
their results can only be met by investigations in which
the same methods are yet more completely and conscientiously
applied."[1]
#/

Resort to suppressive methods is, Acton was profoundly
persuaded, suicidal as well as immoral. It
argues either a timid faith which fears the light, or
a false morality which would do evil that good might
come. "How often have Catholics involved themselves
in hopeless contradiction, sacrificed principle to
opportunity, adapted their theories to their interest,
and staggered the world's reliance on their sincerity
by subterfuges which entangle the Church in the

[Footnote 1: Acton, <i>History of Freedom</i>, p. 452.]
-----File: p121.png--------------------------------------------------------
shifting sands of party warfare, instead of establishing
her cause on the solid rock of principles!"[1]

This noble appeal was unfortunately denounced
by Bishop Ullathorne of Birmingham in a Pastoral
wholly devoted to its refutation. What particularly
disturbed the Bishop's mind was the distinction which
Acton drew between a true and a false religion: that
one judged all things by the standard of their truth,
the other by the touchstone of its own interests. It
appeared to Ullathorne[2] that

/#
"to say that the Church cannot refute or object to
a discovery which will shake the faith of thousands;
meaning thereby to deny her right to examine that
discovery after her own methods, and by the union of
science with faith in her theology, to ascertain whether
and how far that discovery be true, ... is to deny
to the Church her mission to prove all things, and to
hold fast that which is good. It is to deny her
the mission of teaching to avoid oppositions of science
falsely so called, and of protecting those thousands of
souls from having their faith shaken by the erroneous
deductions which men of science are too apt to draw
from those real discoveries which can never conflict
with faith."
#/

Thus was Acton misunderstood. And Bishop
Ullathorne concluded by condemning the journal as
"containing propositions which are respectively subversive
of the faith, heretical, approaching to heresy,
erroneous, derogatory to the teaching of the Church,
and offensive to pious ears."[3]

Notwithstanding this severe rebuke Acton continued
to persevere.

The suppression of Lord Acton's brilliant but short-lived
<i>Home and Foreign Review</i> ilustrates[**typo for illustrates] the restraints

[Footnote 3: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 42. <sc>A.D.</sc> 1862.]
-----File: p122.png--------------------------------------------------------
imposed upon an independent historian by the necessity
of submission to the opinions of Roman Congregations,
such as that of the Index. It was in the year 1863, when
his periodical was some four years old, that Pius IX.
issued a Brief to the Archbishop of Munich in which he
affirmed that

/#
"it is not enough for learned Catholics to receive
and venerate the dogmas of the Church, but there is
also need that they should submit themselves to the
doctrinal decisions of the pontifical congregations."
#/

This Papal Brief made no reference to Lord Acton
or to the <i>Home and Foreign Review</i>, but it vitally
affected the principles upon which that periodical had
been throughout its short existence of four years conducted.
For its principles were these:--

/#
"To reconcile freedom of enquiry with implicit faith,
and to discountenance what is untenable and unreal,
without forgetting the tenderness due to the weak, or
the reverence rightly claimed for what is sacred. Submitting
without reserve to infallible authority, it will
encourage a habit of manly investigation on subjects
of scientific interest."
#/

This means a claim for freedom in the province of
opinion, and a right to the fearless assertion of historic
truth. But how was it possible to reconcile that freedom
with the literary decisions of such a Congregation as
that of the Index? Consequently Lord Acton wrote
a signed article in the <i>Review</i>, bearing the significant
title, "Conflicts with Rome." It is written with admirable
self-command and dignity, with the frankest
confession of loyalty to truth from whatever sources
derived, and under a solemn sense of the impossibility
of reconciling the encroachment of Roman Authority
with the independence essential to historic science. In
-----File: p123.png--------------------------------------------------------
a powerful sketch of the case of Lamennais, he shows
how the extreme assertion of unlimited authority easily
led by reaction to total loss of faith; and how the disparagement
of human reason in the supposed interests
of authority really undermines the foundation upon
which all things human--that authority itself included--must
necessarily rest. On the other side he draws
a striking picture of the general attitude of Roman
authority toward modern thought He says, that in
dealing with literature--

/#
"the paramount consideration of Rome had been
the fear of scandal. Historical investigations, if they
offered perilous occasion to unprepared and unstable
minds, were suppressed"--upon which he remarks
that "the true limits of legitimate authority are one
thing, and the area which authority may find it expedient
to attempt to occupy, is another. The interests
of the Church are not necessarily identical with those
of the ecclesiastical government. One of the great
instruments for preventing historical scrutiny had long
been the Index of Prohibited Books, which was accordingly
directed, not against falsehood only, but particularly
against certain departments of truth. Through it an
effort had been made to keep the knowledge of ecclesiastical
history from the faithful, and to give currency to
a fabulous and fictitious picture of the progress and
action of the Church. The means would have been
found quite inadequate to the end, if it had not been
for the fact that, while society was absorbed by controversy,
knowledge was only valued so far as it served
a controversial purpose. Every party in those days
virtually had its own prohibitive Index, to brand all
inconvenient truths with the note of falsehood. No
party cared for knowledge that could not be made
available for argument."
#/

This suppression of uncongenial fact was less possible
in the German Universities, where the Roman Catholic
-----File: p124.png--------------------------------------------------------
teacher was placed amidst perfect freedom of enquiry,
and where "the system of secrecy or accommodation was
rendered impossible by the competition of knowledge
in which the most thorough exposition of the truth
was sure of the victory." The teacher in this environment
"was obliged often to draw attention to books
lacking the Catholic spirit but indispensable to the
deeper student." The condition of things in Italy
and in Germany was widely different.

/#
"While in Rome it was still held that the truths of
Science need not be told if, in the judgment of Roman
theologians, they were of a nature to offend faith, in
Germany Catholics vied with Protestants in publishing
matter without being diverted by the consideration
whether it might serve or injure their cause in controversy,
or whether it was adverse or favourable to
the views which it was the object of the Index to
protect."
#/

Yet for a while Rome had tolerated many things.
"Publications were suffered to pass unnoted in Germany,
which would have been immediately censured if they
had come forth beyond the Alps or the Rhine."
German philosophers were indeed denounced at Rome,
but German historians escaped censure. The reason
was, according to Lord Acton, plain:--

/#
"The philosopher cannot claim the same exemption
as the historian. God's handwriting exists in history
independently of the Church, and no ecclesiastical
exigence can alter a fact. The divine lesson has been
read, and it is the historian's duty to copy it faithfully
and without ulterior views."
#/

But this toleration of independence in the realm of
facts was now abruptly terminated by authority. The
Pope's letter to the Archbishop of Munich affirmed
-----File: p125.png--------------------------------------------------------
the view that Catholic writers are not bound only by
those decisions of the Infallible Church which regard
articles of faith. They must also submit to the theological
decisions of the Roman congregations, and to the
opinions which are commonly received in the schools;
and it is wrong, though not heretical, to reject those
decisions or opinions.

In a word, therefore, the Brief affirms that the common
opinions and explanations of Catholic divines ought
not to yield to the progress of secular science, and that
the course of theological knowledge ought to be controlled
by the decrees of the Index. Confronted with
this Declaration of Authority, Lord Acton professed
himself resolved "to interpret the words as they were
really meant, and not to elude their consequence by
subtle distinctions, to profess adoption of maxims
which no man who holds the principles of the <i>Review</i>
can accept in their intended signification." In this
Brief--"It is the design of the Holy See not, of course,
to deny the distinction between dogma and opinion, ...
but to reduce the practical recognition of it among
Catholics to the smallest possible limits."

Consequently, the question arose, what future was
possible for the <i>Home and Foreign Review</i>? Continued
existence on unaltered principles meant reiteration of
principles denounced at Rome.

/#
"The periodical reiteration of rejected propositions
would amount to insult and defiance, and would
probably provoke more definite measures; and thus
the result would be to commit authority yet more
irrevocably to an opinion which might otherwise take
no deep root, and might yield ultimately to the influence
of time."
#/

That this change of mind on the part of authority
would be anything else than the far-off outcome of a
-----File: p126.png--------------------------------------------------------
process indefinitely slow, Lord Acton did not for a
moment suppose. He acknowledged that the line
taken by Pius IX. expressed the general sentiment of
the large majority of Catholics of the age. And in
Lord Acton's view of the case, if new truth is to gain
recognition from authority, it

/#
"must first pervade the members in order that it
may reach the head. While the general sentiment of
Catholics is unaltered, the course of the Holy See
remains unaltered too. As soon as that sentiment is
modified, Rome sympathises with the change. The
ecclesiastical government, based upon the public opinion
of the Church, and acting through it, cannot separate
itself from the mass of the faithful, and keep pace with
the progress of the instructed minority. It follows
slowly and warily, and sometimes begins by resisting
and denouncing what in the end it thoroughly adopts....
The slow, silent, indirect action of public opinion
bears the Holy See along, without any demoralising
conflict or dishonourable capitulation. This action it
belongs essentially to the graver scientific literature to
direct."
#/

Meantime, Lord Acton's lot is cast in the period
when truth is resisted and denounced. Hitherto forbearance
has been extended to the minority. But this
is the case no longer. "The adversaries of the Roman
theory have been challenged with the summons to
submit."

/#
"In these circumstances, there are two courses which
it is impossible to take. It would be wrong to abandon
principles which have been well considered and are
sincerely held, and it would also be wrong to assail the
authority which contradicts them. The principles have
not ceased to be true, nor the authority to be legitimate,
because the two are in contradiction."
#/
-----File: p127.png--------------------------------------------------------
Accordingly, Lord Acton's practical solution is as
follows:--

/#
"Warned, therefore, by the language of the Brief, I
will not provoke ecclesiastical authority to a more
explicit repudiation of doctrines which are necessary
to secure its influence upon the advance of modern
science.... I will sacrifice the existence of the <i>Review</i>
to the defence of its principles, in order that I may
continue the obedience which is due to legitimate
ecclesiastical authority with an equally conscientious
maintenance of the rightful and necessary liberty of
thought."
#/

From that date accordingly the <i>Home and Foreign
Review</i> ceased to exist. The expiration of a periodical
may be an exceedingly small incident in literary
activity, but the principles involved in this incident
are of primary importance. Lord Acton's indomitable
belief in the ultimate prevalence of historical truth,
when the present tyranny of ignorance should be overpast,
is worthy of all regard. The dignified surrender,
coupled with frank reassertion of unaltered conviction,
is most significant. He bows to an authority which
has trangressed its limits, and which rejects to-day
what it must of necessity at length believe. His
theory that the truth must pervade and possess the
members in order that it may reach the head, must
have sounded strangely in Italian ears. A silence
explicitly self-imposed, lest authority, if further provoked,
should commit itself irrevocably to positions
fatal to its own best interests, is impressive and pathetic;
but certainly it suggests thoughts on the limits of
authority incompatible with Ultramontane assumptions.
While this subsiding into silence would prevent
the irretrievable mischief of imprudent authoritative
declarations, it would, at the same time, delay the
-----File: p128.png--------------------------------------------------------
enlightenment of the ignorant majority, and so delay
the enlightenment of the head. Worse still, such
silence, if widespread, must disable the Church from
meeting the needs of modern thought, and from coping
with, still more from guiding, the educated world.
Wherever the system of secrecy and accommodation is
rendered impossible, by the competition of knowledge
in which the most thorough exposition of the truth
is sure of the victory, there such methods as those
advocated in the Brief, or practised in submission to
its dictation, must be fatal to the Church's wider
influence. We may reverence the individual self-suppression,
but nothing can be more profoundly discouraging
than the fatal conflict of authority with
historic truth. Even Lord Acton's faith could only
hope that authority might ultimately acknowledge the
principles upon whose suppression it was for the present
actively engaged. Thus the Church, in his view, was
committed to a fruitless conflict with truths to which
it must at last surrender. It was destined evermore to
oppose all truth for which the ignorance of the majority
precluded recognition; to silence its prophets and hereafter
adorn their sepulchres; to denounce as injurious
what it would one day embrace as true; if, indeed, the
slowly increasing enlightenment of the general body of
the devout shall ultimately remove the prejudices of the
head. Certainly the prospect was scarcely one to cheer.
It shows impressively the tremendous strain which the
encroachment of authority over the province of opinion
placed upon the faith of its noblest sons.

Bishop Ullathorne viewed the successive collapse of
Acton's journals with a natural satisfaction.

/#
"The unsound taint," he wrote, "was brought to
England by certain young laymen, pupils of Dr Döllinger
#/
-----File: p129.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
or others associated with him, and exhibited itself in
the later numbers of the <i>Rambler</i> after it passed into
their hands, in the <i>Home and Foreign Review</i>, the <i>North
British Review</i>, and the <i>Chronicle</i>. But the Catholics
of this country repelled the poison, and these publications
dropped rapidly one after another into their
grave."[1]
#/

Meanwhile, on the other side, Ward's ambition was
to demonstrate "how extensive is the intellectual
captivity imposed by God on every loyal Catholic."[2]
And there is no possibility to doubt which of the two
schools was congenial to Roman authority. For the
editor of the <i>Dublin Review</i> was rewarded with
expressions of papal approval, while Lord Acton's
literary ventures were one after another brought to
untimely ends.[3] But the thing that flourished, the
work upon whose eccentricities and extravagances
Roman authority looked with favour, was the Apologetic
of Ward in the <i>Dublin Review</i>. Utterly
unhistorical as it assuredly was, more Ultramontane
than Rome itself, carrying recent development to
unprecedented excess, and exhibiting exactly those
characteristics of wilful blindness to uncongenial facts
which roused so justly Acton's moral indignation,
Ward's Essays were nevertheless the approved and
sanctioned type of Roman doctrine and Roman defence
offered for the edification and guidance of Roman
Catholics in this land. There is something exceedingly
tragic in the suppression of Acton's plea for sincerity
and moral rectitude, coupled with the encouragement
given to the reckless and painfully superficial utterances
of the <i>Dublin Review</i>.

The English Romanists as a body were scared by

[Footnote 1: <i>Expostulation</i>, p. 5.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Essays on the Church's Doctrinal Authority</i>, pp. 20, 34.]

[Footnote 3: Cf. <i>Church Times</i>, 26th July 1907.]
-----File: p130.png--------------------------------------------------------
Ward's extravagance. And to none were his methods
more repugnant than they were to John Henry
Newman. By a singular grace, Newman escaped the
convert's proverbial temptation--that of carrying new
beliefs to all possible extremes. He had affinities with
the <i>Dublin Review</i> and with Lord Acton's Journals.
But he was keenly conscious of the defects of both.
He thought the one lacking in regard for authority,
the other in reverence for fact. He was very far from
identifying himself with either.

When Ward attempted to enlist Newman in his Infallibility
campaign, Newman's characteristic sincerity did
not attempt to conceal the repugnance with which he
viewed the proposal.

/#
"As to writing a volume on the Pope's Infallibility
it never so much as entered into my thought. I am
a controversialist, not a theologian, and I should have
nothing to say about it. I have ever thought it likely
to be true, never thought it certain. I think, too, its
definition inexpedient and unlikely; but I should have
no difficulty in accepting it, were it made. And I
don't think my reason will ever go forward or back-*ward
in the matter."[1]
#/

But Newman despaired of inducing his fellow
Romanists to attend to history.

/#
"Nothing would be better," he wrote, "than a
historical review. But who would bear it? Unless
one doctored all one's facts one would be thought a
bad Catholic. The truth is, there is a keen conflict
going on just now between two parties--one in the
Church, one out of it; and at such seasons extreme
views alone are in favour, and a man who is not
extravagant is thought treacherous. I sometimes think
of King Lear's daughters, and consider that they, after
#/

[Footnote 1: 1866, Thureau Dangin, iii. p. 111; Purcell, <i>Manning</i>, ii. p. 321.]
-----File: p131.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
all, may be found the truest who are in speech more
measured."[1]
#/

Hence it was that Ward's vehement and exaggerated
Ultramontanism drew down upon him one of the
severest rebukes which Newman perhaps ever wrote.
He told Ward that it was wholly uncatholic in spirit,
and was constituting a church within the Church.
Ward comically observed that after such a letter he
must take a double dose of chloral if he meant to
sleep.

Newman also wrote a reassuring letter to Pusey,
expressing his belief that there was no fear of a decree
of Papal Infallibility, except in so limited a form as
practically to leave things as they were.[2] But when
the Vatican Council was already met, and the probabilities
that the dominant party might succeed in
reducing to fixity what had hitherto been a theological
opinion, at the most, became more and more convincing,
Newman wrote to his Bishop in a very different and
very anxious strain:--

/#
"Why should an insolent, aggressive faction be
allowed to make the heart of the just sad, whom the
Lord hath not made sorrowful? I pray those early
doctors of the Church whose intercession would decide
the matter (Augustine, Ambrose,and Jerome; Athanasius,
Chrysostom, and Basil) to avert this great calamity. If
it is God's will that the Pope's Infallibility be defined,
then it is God's will to throw back the times and
moments of the triumph which He has destined for
His kingdom, and I shall feel that I have but to bow
my head to His inscrutable Providence."[3]

This memorable sentence, the most memorable of
any from the Roman Communion in England, was
written in the full confidence of privacy to his own
Diocesan, Ullathorne, Roman Bishop of Birmingham.
Somehow it came to light, and appeared in the public
press. The publication, never explained, has been
called a culpable indiscretion.[1] But whatever it be
called, it assuredly represents the writer's most profound
conviction, uttered with perfect frankness. Here, as to
his Father in Christ, he reveals his soul. Trusted and
confided in as he was by individuals on either side
within the Roman body; by Ward and Faber on the
one hand, and by Lord Acton on the other; profoundly
intimate with modern thought and religious conceptions
beyond the Roman pale; he anticipates disastrous consequences
to the Church, and to the world, if the
Infallibility theory be decreed.

Bishop Ullathorne[2] would undoubtedly receive this
confidence with perfect sympathy. For, although a
believer of the doctrine, he had himself, as a student,
been taught the opposite at Downside. Indeed, his
own fidelity to Ultramontane ideas was so challenged
that he thought it advisable to seek a special interview
with the Pope, and assure him, at the time of the
Vatican Decrees. But, naturally, Newman's letter not
only produced a great sensation when it appeared
in the public press; it also deepened the distrust
with which the partisans of Infallibility regarded him.
We can well understand how one who wrote with
so manifest an anxiety to stand by the historic past,
and to avoid extremes, was regarded with suspicion
from Rome by pronounced and uncompromising
Ultramontanes.

[Footnote 2: <i>Autobiography</i>, p. 41. Cf. Purcell, <i>Manning</i>, ii. p. 439.]
-----File: p133.png--------------------------------------------------------

As always in great movements, so with the doctrine
of Papal Infallibility, much depended on commanding
personalities. And no figure in the conflict of 1870
is more conspicuous than that of Archbishop Manning.
It was not for his learning or intellectual depth or piety
that he held so remarkable a place in promoting
Ultramontane opinions. But there is no doubt that,
whether outside the Council or within, he arrested
universal attention. No man was more completely
identified with the doctrine than he; and identified
with it in its extremest form. No paradox alarmed
him; he shrank from no inference, however strange.
Bellarmine would have been proud of him as in many
ways a worthy successor to his own <i>à priori</i> methods.
It is impossible to mistake the temperament which produced
the two famous Pastorals launched by Manning
for the instruction of English Romanists in 1867 and
1869.

He has already, and this is very significant, formulated
the doctrine practically in the same phrases in which
it appeared in the Vatican Decree: "Declarations of
the Head of the Church apart from the Episcopate
are infallible."[1] "Judgments <i>ex cathedra</i> are, in their
essence, judgments of the Pontiff apart from the
episcopal body, whether congregated or dispersed."[2]

This doctrine, he is certain, the Church has always
believed and taught. History awakens no doubts,
creates no problems, to Manning's mind. Everywhere
he contemplates, both exercised and admitted, papal
inerrancy. His theory is that the stages of the doctrine
have been three: simple belief, analysis, definition. In
the first period, belief in the Church's and the Pope's
inerrancy pervaded all the world. Thus he thinks that
the condemnation of Pelagianism by Innocent I. (418)

[Footnote 1: <i>Pastoral</i> (1867), p. 23.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid</i>. (1869), p. 142.]
-----File: p134.png--------------------------------------------------------
was regarded as infallible from the first moment of
its promulgation. As for Honorius, there is not the
slightest reason for misgivings: "heretical he could
not be." We have his letters. They prove his
Catholicity. The papal acts of the primitive ages
imply infallibility, according to Manning, "and in
almost all cases explicitly declare it."[1] The exercise of
authority is everywhere to him Infallibility. Thus the
Archbishop presented the English Romanist with a
sketch of the first ages pervaded by a calm, unchallenged
faith in the Pope's Infallibility.

The second period in the doctrine's progress is
that of analysis and contention. And here Manning
pours unqualified contempt on the Gallican view.
Gallicanism was Manning's peculiar and special
abomination.

/#
"Gallicanism," he said, "is rationalism; that which the
Gospel cast out; that which grew up again in mediæval
Christendom. Gallicanism is no more than a transient
and modern opinion which arose in France, without
warrant or antecedent, in the ancient theological schools
of the great French Church; a royal theology, as
suddenly developed and as parenthetical as the Thirty-nine
Articles; affirmed only by a small number out of
the numerous Episcopate of France....

"To this may be added, that the name of Bossuet
escaped censure only out of indulgence, by reason of
his good services to the Church: and that even the
lawfulness of giving absolution to those who defend
the Gallican Articles has been gravely questioned."[2]
#/

In Manning's view of history, Gallicanism was a
disease engendered by the corruptions of the old
French Monarchy.

The third period in the progress of Infallibility is the

[Footnote 1: <i>Pastoral</i> (1867), p. 40.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 41.]
-----File: p135.png--------------------------------------------------------
period of definition. This is certain to come. It is
merely a question of time.

Thus, according to Manning, the doctrine of Papal
Infallibility is no more of an innovation than the
doctrine of our Lord's Divinity at Nicæa. It is true
that he is conscious of a possible objection lurking
in suspicious minds.

/#
"If any one shall answer that these evidences do not
prove the Infallibility of the Pope speaking <i>ex cathedra</i>,
they will lose their labour.

"I adduce them," he continues, "to prove the immemorial
and universal practice of the Church in
having recourse to the Apostolic See as the last and
certain witness and judge of the Divine tradition of faith."
#/

But Manning's real interests were not in endeavours
to ascertain what history declares. The sole duty of
the believer was absolute submission to the authority
of the existing Church, irrespective of past teachings.
The assumption that what is taught to-day corresponds
with what always has been, was made, and must not
be challenged. Hence the famous identification of
history with heresy, for which Manning made himself
responsible. His assurance of the doctrine is so unassailable
that he can scarcely tolerate the enquiry,
Is it true?

/#
"The question is not," he writes, "whether the
doctrine be true, which cannot be doubted; or definable,
which is not open to doubt; but whether such a
definition be opportune, that is, timely and prudent."[1]
#/

Or again, more emphatically still if possible--

/#
"With the handful of Catholics who do not believe
the Infallibility of the Vicar of Jesus Christ, speaking
#/

[Footnote 1: <i>Pastoral</i> (1867), p. 119.]
-----File: p136.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
<i>ex cathedra</i>, we will not now occupy ourselves. But
the opinion of those who believe the doctrine to be
true, but its definition to be inopportune deserves
full and considerate examination."
#/

That the doctrine is opportune, said Manning, followed
at once from the fact that it was true. God has revealed
it. "Can it be permitted to us to think that what He
has thought it opportune to reveal, it is not opportune
for us to declare?" If it be said that many revealed
truths are not defined, Manning answers, Yes, but
"this revealed truth has been denied." "If the Infallibility
of the visible Head of the Church had never been
denied, it might not have been necessary to define it
now." Thus the prospect of a coming definition is
held <i>in terrorem</i> over the heads of any who do not
silently acquiesce in the doctrine being taught. Manning
could scarcely ignore the fact that this denial of
Infallibility was no new thing in the Roman Church.
His answer to this is equally significant.

/#
"We are told by objectors that the denial is far more
ancient and widespread: that only makes the definition
all the more necessary."[1] "In England, some Catholics
are stunned and frightened by the pretentious assumption
of patristic learning and historical criticism of
anonymous writers, until they doubt, or shrink in false
shame from believing a truth for which their fathers
died."[2]
#/

One would like to know how this sounded to the old
Catholic families of England, to Bishops such as
Errington or Clifford, to those whose fathers had
assured the English Government on oath that Papal
Infallibility formed no part of the faith of Catholics.

Manning indeed saw a host of practical reasons why

[Footnote 1: <i>Pastoral</i> (1867), p. 40[**.]]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 41.]
-----File: p137.png--------------------------------------------------------
the inerrancy doctrine should be decreed: because this
truth has been denied; because, if not decreed, the
error will henceforward appear to be tolerated, or at
least left in impunity; because this denial of what
Manning called "the traditional belief of the Church"
was an organised opposition to the prerogatives of
the Holy See; "because it is needed to place the
Pontifical Acts of the last 300 years, both in declaring
the truth, as in the dogma of the Immaculate Conception,
and in condemning errors, as in the long series
of propositions condemned in ... Jansen and others,
beyond cavil or question"; because it was openly said
that the pastors of the Church are not unanimous,
therefore "it is of the highest moment to expose
and extinguish this false allegation, so boldly and
invidiously made by heretics and schismatics of every
name."

The dogma was necessary also to justify the believer's
attitude toward the Pope. Faith, argued Manning,
requires the Infallibility of the teacher of truth. If the
teacher be fallible, our certainty cannot be Divine. If
the Pope be fallible, we cannot be certain that the
doctrines propounded by him--the Immaculate Conception,
for instance--are of faith. "The treatise of
Divine Faith is therefore incomplete so long as the
Infallibility of the proponent is not fully defined."

Thus a theoretical system requires completion which
nothing but this dogma can give; for which, therefore,
this dogma must be created. Moreover, Manning
scorns what he calls "the incoherence of admitting a
supremacy and denying its infallible action." We
have here a reminiscence of De Maistre. There is
the same theorising tendency. Two dominant ideas
are found throughout. The one, that the doctrine is
required to secure the completion of an <i>à priori</i> view.
-----File: p138.png--------------------------------------------------------
The other, that it will be practically a singularly useful
asset. Therefore we must have it. It is not the
theologian, it is the ecclesiastical statesman who speaks
in this. The centralisation of power, concentrated in
one supreme individual, easily accessible, prompt to
reply, was Manning's ideal. He contrasted it with
the slow, deliberate method of Universal Assemblies.
Errors would have time to spread, with fearful rapidity,
before this heavy machinery could be brought effectively
into operation. Statesmen would frustrate its
assembling. If the Pope be personally infallible, apart
from the Episcopate, "why," asks Manning quite
naturally,

/#
"why is he bound to take a means which demands
an Ecumenical Council, or a world-wide and protracted
interrogation, with all the delays and uncertainties of
correspondence, when, by the Divine order, a certain
means in the Apostolic See is always at hand?"
#/

Assertion--vigorous, uncompromising, sweeping--was
not only the bent of Manning's disposition; it was
also cultivated on principle. What the English people
wanted, according to the Archbishop of Westminster,
was neither compromise nor accommodation. "Down-*right
truth, boldly and broadly stated, like the ring
of true metal, wins their confidence." When Gladstone
described him as "the oracle," Manning replied, "He
shall not find me ambiguous." Thus he prided himself
on the quality of aggressive speech. Among his
favourite phrases is the term--"it is certain." Six
times in one page, applied to all manner of things--historical
interpretations, future probabilities, indiscriminately.
No shade of distinction exists. There
might be no such thing conceivable as hesitation in the
-----File: p139.png--------------------------------------------------------
universe. He seems to grow, if possible, increasingly
sharp, incisive, uncompromising, as his words speed on.

/#
"The Ultramontane opinion is simply this, that the
Pontiff, speaking <i>ex cathedra</i> on faith or morals, is
infallible. In this there are no shades or moderations.
It is simply aye or no."
#/

Of qualifications, of restrictions, nothing is said. It is
all sweepingly universal. Yet with all his heart, he
says, he desires to find a mode of conciliation--"but
not a <i>via media</i> which is the essential method of falsehood."
Of the philosophic temper, the balancing of
opposing truths, the holding truths unreconciled, through
faith in their ultimate yet hitherto undiscovered synthesis,
there is not a shadow in these amazing Pastorals.

Nothing can surpass the confidence with which
Manning expressed his ideas of the work which the
Council would effect.

/#
"It is certain that upon a multitude of minds who
are wavering and doubtful ... the voice of a General
Council will have great power. The Council of Trent,"
he tells us, "fixed the epoch after which Protestantism
never spread. The next General Council will probably
date the period of its dissolution."[1]
#/

Not less singular, especially when read in the light of
Manning's incessant polemical correspondence on the
doctrine, is the picture which he has drawn of the state
of the Roman Church in this crisis.

There is universal excitement, he says, in the outer
world, caused by the assembling of the Council at
Rome; "not, indeed, within the unity of the Catholic
Church, where all is calm in the strength of quiet and

[Footnote 1: <i>Pastoral</i> (1867), p. 90.]
-----File: p140.png--------------------------------------------------------
of confidence, but outside in the political and religious
world"--the calm of the <i>Dublin Review</i>, for instance,
and the passionate rhetoric of Ward.

Manning further predicts that if this doctrine were
defined, it would be at once received throughout the
world with "universal joy and unanimity." Nothing
can prove more clearly than these words how completely
the theory with which he was identified fired
his imagination, and warped his judgment.

Manning entirely failed to carry the English Romanists
with him. The English Bishops at Rome elected Grant,
not Manning, as their candidate for the Commission of
Faith. And the Archbishop was adopted by the Italians.
He complained of his English colleagues, that "of those
who ought to have defended Infallibility not one spoke.
The laity were averse and impatient They would not
read."[1] Some, however, did read, among them Lord
Acton, who characterised those Pastorals as "elaborate
absurdities." They were read also by De Lisle, who was
amazed at Manning's theory on the case of Honorius.

/#
"Archbishop Manning denies that Honorius fell into
heresy, but in denying this he appears to me to injure
the Catholic cause, for he denies history, and what is
worse, sets himself up against a General Council which
is universally received, and which in this very particular
was solemnly confirmed by Pope Leo II., Honorius's
next successor but one."[2]
#/

Most significant is the contrast of type between
Manning and Newman within the Communion of Rome.

/#
"Manning," says Thureau Dangin, "like other converts
in the ardour of their new faith, and in reaction
against the Protestant spirit from which he had escaped,
considered that he could not go too far in conceptions
#/

[Footnote 1: Purcell, ii. p. 454.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Life of De Lisle</i>, ii. p. 73.]
-----File: p141.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
designated 'Ultramontane.' The personal attractiveness
of Pius IX., who manifested a fatherly confidence
in him, the authority which thus accrued to him in the
government of the Church, the storm of controversy
before and after the Vatican Council--all confirmed
him in this attitude. He was more concerned to extend
Infallibility than to determine its limits. He seemed to
make it a duty of conscience and a point of honour to
offend the English Catholics by presenting in uncompromising
terms precisely those features of Italian
doctrine which scandalised them most. He was well
aware of his unpopularity, and consoled himself with
an application of the text, If I pleased men I should
not be the servant of Christ."
#/

However, Manning pleased men, at least in Rome,
where the larger sympathies of Newman were most
distasteful, and where a hardy official went so far as to
describe him as more Anglican than the Anglicans, and
the most dangerous man in England.

Meanwhile Manning is found denouncing the English
Jesuits to Rome as sympathisers with a watered version
of Catholicism. Thus the Roman Catholics in England
were being thoroughly schooled in Ultramontanism, and
the Jesuits themselves Romanised by a convert from
another Church.

The conclusions to which our investigations lead
are: that the Roman Communion in England during
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was Catholic
in sentiment as opposed to Ultramontane; that the
process of change was wrought by Italian influence,
imposing Italianised Bishops upon a reluctant community,
and by the suppression of the organs of
independent thought, especially those which did not
revise the facts of history in the interests of edification;
that this conversion of the Roman body to Ultramontane
ideas necessitated a rewriting of the English
-----File: p142.png--------------------------------------------------------
Roman literature, which was done on a very extensive
scale, and constantly without any acknowledgment of
the changes introduced into the author's opinions; that
this process of infiltration was vigorously resisted, and
continued incomplete down to the Council of 1870, in
which Irish and English Bishops openly opposed the
theories of papal prerogatives which their Italianised
rulers had laboured to force upon them.

CHAPTER XI

ULTRAMONTANISM IN FRANCE


1. A powerful if unintentional contribution to
Ultramontanism was Napoleon's reconstruction of the
French Episcopate.

The nineteenth century found the Church of France
in a desperate condition. Overthrown by the Revolution,
and deprived of its possessions and its sanctuaries,
many of its Royalist Bishops were refugees in England
from a form of government which they abhorred; and
the Pope himself (Pius VI.) died, a captive of the
Revolution, in French territory (1799).[1] But with the
new century Napoleon rose to power. He saw that, in
spite of the dominant Atheism, France was Catholic at
heart; and resolved upon a restoration of the Catholic
Church. Accordingly he sided with the Papacy. But
since the exiled prelates were notoriously hostile to
the Revolution, being zealous adherents of the old
Monarchy, he was convinced that their readmission
would provoke social disorder and irreconcilable strife.
On this ground he required Pope Pius VII. to make
a clean sweep of the entire French Episcopate, either by
their resignation or their deprivation.[2] This was to be
followed by a complete reconstruction of the dioceses,
and reappointment to the newly-constituted Sees. Fifty

[Footnote 1: Jervis, iii. p. 323.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i>]
-----File: p144.png--------------------------------------------------------
diocesan Bishops were henceforward to exist, together
with twelve Archbishops, while more than half the
ancient Gallican Episcopate was to be entirely swept
away. Against this revolutionary proposal Pius VII.
protested, but he protested in vain. The master of
France was inexorable, and Pius was compelled to
yield. Cardinal Consalvi,[1] the Papal Secretary, says that
he vainly urged that the deposition of one hundred
French Bishops without condemnation was unprecedented
in the annals of Christendom, that nothing
could be more ruinous to the famous Gallican liberties.
But the iron will of Napoleon broke through all remonstrances,
and the Pope was compelled to require
the French Bishops to place their resignation in his
hands.[2]

Some complied. Some delayed and temporised.
Others refused. The refugees in England replied that,
holding their episcopal commission from the Holy
Spirit, who had constituted them rulers in the Church
of God, they could not submit to the Pope's requirements.[3]
Nevertheless, their existence was ignored,
and the combined power of Pius VII. and Napoleon
Bonaparte carried this ecclesiastical revolution into
effect.

Napoleon reserved to himself the right of appointment
to the newly constituted Sees.[4] This unprecedented
act of supreme authority[5] was, of course,
altogether distinct from Infallibility; but it formed a
precedent for almost limitless submission, and promoted
a spirit of resignation to authority, which afterwards
exhibited itself in the province of dogmatic truth, and
contributed indirectly not a little to the passing of the

[Footnote 5: Lord Acton calls it "the most arbitrary act ever done by a Pope."--<i>Hist.
Freedom</i>, p. 323.]
-----File: p145.png--------------------------------------------------------
Vatican Decree. It also shook the whole constitution
of the Church of France. Its effect on Gallican ideas
was naturally great.

The French Minister Ollivier goes so far as to
maintain that the Roman Court, in spite of its persistent
efforts, would only have secured uncertain advantage if
the French Revolution had not come to its aid.[1]

But still down to 1870 the French Government
retained in its control the right of nominating the
Bishops. And this right it exercised independently of
the papal desires. Pronounced Gallicans were elevated
to the Episcopate in spite of Pius IX.'s objections. At
times, when his concurrence was delayed, pressure was
instantly brought to bear from France. And that
pressure it was not prudent to resist; for at that period
France was the protector of the Papacy.

It is sometimes said that the old Gallicanism perished
in the French Revolution. This is misleading. The
Church and the Monarchy had stood together, and
the overthrow of the one broke the power of the
other. In the altered circumstances the papal claim
over monarchs became practically impossible. It was
never denied at Rome, but it was not asserted. It
was left discreetly in the background, and consequently
the old Gallican political protest became meaningless.
But the old spiritual principles were re-affirmed in
France in 1820 by Cardinal de la Luzerne with not less
vigour and frankness than in the days of Bossuet.

The independence of the temporal power from
papal authority, says Cardinal Luzerne,[2] is a question
which he does not intend to discuss. Not because he
has the slightest doubt upon the subject; on the
contrary, the complete independence of the temporal
power is of all the Gallican maxims that to which

[Footnote 1: Ollivier, i. p. 280.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Works</i> (Migne's ed.), ii. 14.]
-----File: p146.png--------------------------------------------------------
he is personally most strongly attached. He deplores
from the depth of his heart that the Popes ever asserted
the opposite principle. Their pretensions have been
disastrous to the Catholic Church, and particularly so
to the Holy See. But his reason for not discussing
the subject is that the Gallican principle finds hardly
any opponents even in Italy. Since Italian writers
do not attack it there is no need to defend.

But on the question of Papal Infallibility he feels
constrained to express his strong adhesion to the
Gallican doctrine.[1] The partisans of Infallibility affirm
that when the Pope, taking the necessary precautions,
speaks officially, he is infallible, and his decisions are
unalterable laws for all the Church. That is the
Ultramontane opinion. We, on the contrary, says
Cardinal Luzerne, do not believe the Holy Father to
be infallible. We believe that when he acts as Pope
his decisions ought to be respected; but his dogmatic
decrees, however worthy of regard, are not infallible,
and only exact an outward submission, but not an
inward assent until they are endorsed by the acceptance
of the Universal Church. Papal decisions have
weight--some more, some less. They are not equal
in authority, and none of them are infallible. The
Ultramontane system, that the Pope is infallible when
he speaks officially, sins against the truth in the essential
point of novelty.[2] Gallicanism, if it had a political side,
was essentially ecclesiastical and spiritual. Its political
interest was to protect the rights and claims of a
national Church. It regarded the Church of each people
as a definite entity, although of course merged in the
unity of the Universal Church. But this was not the
fundamental principle of the Gallican idea. The heart
and centre of their contention lay in the rights of the

[Footnote 1: <i>Works</i>, ii. p. 37.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 38.]
-----File: p147.png--------------------------------------------------------
Collective Episcopate, as contrasted with the claims of
the Papacy. And the whole of the struggle which
issued in the Vatican Assembly of 1870 was a struggle
between these two conceptions of spiritual authority.

The extent to which the old Gallican principles prevailed
in France of the early nineteenth century
may be gathered from Bergier's Theological Dictionary,
which was the French popular encyclopedia of theology,
and obtained a great circulation.

/#
"<i>Infallibilist</i>--The name sometimes given to those
who maintain that the Pope is infallible,--that is to
say, that when he addresses to the entire Church a
dogmatic decree, a decision on a point of doctrine, it
cannot happen that this decision should be false or
subject to mistake. This is the ordinary opinion of
Ultramontane theologians."[1]
#/

Then after summarising Bossuet's teaching, the article
concludes that, since it is an essential function of the
pastors of the Church to witness to the universal faith, the
witness of the sovereign Pontiff taken by itself cannot
produce the same degree of moral certitude which
results from a very considerable number of concurrent
witnesses. As head of the Universal Church, the
sovereign Pontiff is undoubtedly well informed as to
the general belief and is its principal witness; but his
witness, united to that of a vast multitude of Bishops,
possesses quite a different force than when it is alone.

<tb>

2. There were the Ultramontane writers in France,
who contributed vastly to the propagation of Roman
ideas.

One of the pioneers of Ultramontane development
was Joseph de Maistre. Connected for some time

[Footnote 1: Bergier, <i>Dictionnaire de Théologie</i> (1850).]
-----File: p148.png--------------------------------------------------------
in the first half of the nineteenth century with the
Court of St Petersburg, he had all the instincts of the
diplomatist; and his religious ideal was to see modern
Christian society under the absolute control of the
political papal dictatorship of the Middle Ages.
Manning once ventured the remark that Gratry was
no theologian. It has been said with far more accuracy
that De Maistre was neither an historian nor a
theologian, but rather one who transferred to the
province of ecclesiastical control the principles and
methods of diplomatic procedure. He was a man of
remarkable vigour and pertinacity; a man of logic in
his way, pushing relentlessly to extreme conclusions
on the basis of a brilliant assumption; audacious in his
assertions, and confident with an unsurpassed serenity.

The movements of modern thought, the aspirations
towards larger freedom, were to De Maistre thoroughly
repugnant.

/#
"The audacious race of Japhet," he writes, "has never
ceased to advance towards what it describes as liberty;
that is, towards a state in which the governed is
governed as little as possible, and is always on guard
against its masters."
#/

Such was his attitude towards European progress
and development. This was written in 1844, and may
doubtless be partly explained by the time; but this
was the spirit in which he approached the doctrine
of papal authority. And the method in which he
attempted to advance the Ultramontane opinions may
be gathered from such examples as the following.

If the Gallican School set the Council above
the Pope, as the final judge in matters of faith,
De Maistre entirely depreciates the significance of
Ecumenical Councils. His estimate of their value as
-----File: p149.png--------------------------------------------------------
compared with his valuation of the Papacy is almost
contemptuous. Councils are, in his view, periodical or
intermittent exhibitions of sovereignty. They are
extremely rare, purely accidental, without any regularity
of recurrence; easier to assemble in primitive days
when the extent of Christendom was comparatively
small. But in modern times an Ecumenical Council is
a mere chimera. It would take five or six years to
arrange. If the objection is made, Why were all these
Councils held if the decision of the Pope sufficed? De
Maistre adopts for his reply the following--"Don't ask
me; ask the Greek Emperors, who would have these
Councils assembled, and who convoked them and
demanded the consent of the Popes, and raised all this
useless fracas in the Church." De Maistre goes further
still. Quoting the opinion of Hume on the Council of
Trent, that "it is the only General Council which has
been held in an age truly learned and inquisitive," and
"that no one expects to see another General Council
until the decay of learning and the progress of ignorance
shall again fit mankind for these great impostures";
he calmly observes that while in its spirit this is a
"reflexion brutale," yet in its substance it is worthy of
consideration. Hume is right to this extent: that "the
more the world becomes enlightened the less it will
think of holding a General Council." The world, he
adds, has become too great for General Councils, which
appear better adapted for the youth of Christianity.
He admits that a Council may, indeed, be serviceable,
and that perhaps the Council of Trent did what
only a Council could do. But he is so exceedingly
jealous of its possible interference with the absolute
sovereignty of the Pope that he can find no more than
this in its favour; except to conclude this portion of
his remarks with a curiously incongruous protestation of
-----File: p150.png--------------------------------------------------------
his perfect orthodoxy on the subject of General Councils.
Thus De Maistre's Ultramontane proclivities completely
blinded him to the true nature of this form of Catholic
self-expression. We should not gather from his
depreciative words that the Spirit of God had anything
to do with the Councils of Christendom. It is singular,
moreover, that a leader of modern Extremist views
should have written in this strain only twenty-six years
before the Vatican Council.

De Maistre's treatment of the case of Honorius forms
a most curious psychological study. The condemnation
of Honorius by a General Council was to the Gallican
School a conclusive proof that the Church which so
expressed itself knew nothing of Ultramontane opinions
on Papal Infallibility. De Maistre has a theory which
we believe is entirely his own. He draws from imagination
an account of what Honorius might, from an
Ultramontane standpoint, be expected to have said if
he had been living at the time, and had entered into
the deliberations of the Council which condemned him.
Here is the speech which Honorius, it appears, ought
to have made:--

/#
"My brothers, God has undoubtedly abandoned you,
since you dare to judge the Head of the Church who
is established to pass judgment upon you. I have no
need of your assembling to condemn Monothelitism.
What can you say that I have not said already? My
decisions are sufficient for the Church. I dissolve this
Council by withdrawing from it."
#/

De Maistre could scarcely forget that the successor
of Honorius, who on his theory ought to have made
some protest against the Council's audacious treatment of
their predecessor, omitted to make any. This is met
with the remark that if certain successors of Honorius
-----File: p151.png--------------------------------------------------------
do not appear to have roused themselves against
"the Hellenisms of Constantinople," their silence only
proves their humility and their prudence, and has no
dogmatic weight. The facts meanwhile continue what
they are. The fact that the successors of Honorius
for centuries went on reiterating his condemnation is
not mentioned by De Maistre. But, as he truly says,
the facts meanwhile continue what they are. Yet
he implies that they do not. For he then suggests
that perhaps the Acts of the Sixth Council have been
falsified. The possibility of such dishonesty in ancient
times is illustrated from the letters of Cicero. The application
is then delicately left for the reader to make.
As for the author, "Quant à moi, je n'ai pas le temps
de me livrer à l'examen de cette question superflue."

De Maistre's argument for Papal Infallibility is a
political argument pure and simple. All true government
in human society is monarchy. And the ultimate
decision in the political order must be regarded as
an infallible decision. The sovereign power cannot
permit the laws to be called in question. What
sovereignty is in the political order, the same is infallibility
in the spiritual. We only demand, therefore,
for the Church the same prerogative of finality which
we demand for the State.[1]

Readers of Mozley on <i>Development</i> will remember
his crushing reply to this transparent sophism.

/#
"It is indeed absurd," writes Mozley, "to expect
that the mind should be satisfied with it, because
what the mind wants is to believe what is true; and
this argument does not touch the question of truth
or error in the doctrines themselves decided on by
this ultimate authority. It tells us the fact that they
are decided on, and no more. It views the Church
#/

[Footnote 1: <i>Du Pape</i>, p. 20.]
-----File: p152.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
simply as a polity, and professes to apply the same
principles to it which belong to other polities; and,
wholly omitting its prophetical office of teaching truth,
makes it impose its dogmas on us on the same principle
on which the State imposes Acts of Parliament."[1]
#/

This contribution to Ultramontanism received a
criticism, also from the Roman Bishop Maret, just on
the eve of the Vatican Council.

/#
"These weaknesses," says Maret, "of an able mind
may remind us that the true seat of sovereignty and
infallibility in the Church is not to be reached by
logic but by appeal to Scripture and Tradition. Joseph
de Maistre has not recognised this necessity. If he
had not been a partisan dominated by a pre-conceived
theory based on insecure foundations, he would have
realised that a writer's first duty was to make a careful
study of the General Councils, if he would understand
the Church's constitution. And this he has most inadequately
done."[2]
#/

Here then, said a contemporary French critic,[3] we
have the doctrine of infallible authority humanised and
rationalised. But the contradiction is too gross to permit
this solution of the problem to be taken literally. The
<i>tour de force</i> is too puerile. We decline to believe
that De Maistre was altogether duped by it. It is
impossible that he could not have seen the huge abyss
which separates Infallibility, as the Church understands
it, from civil sovereignty and final judicial appeal.
The former not only demands submission, but assent,
belief. The second only imposes respect and exterior
obedience, without involving any interior conviction

[Footnote 1: Mozley, <i>Essay on Development</i>, p. 126.]

[Footnote 2: Maret, ii. p. 313.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i> (1858), p. 643.]
-----File: p153.png--------------------------------------------------------
or belief; without preventing discussion, contradiction,
and reversal by subsequent legislation.

The ability of De Maistre is everywhere acknowledged.
But he is a crowning illustration of error by excess.
He is afflicted, as the same critic said, with the malady
of logical intemperance. He is a victim of his own
love of paradox. His passionate, masterful desire to
push everything to the most extreme conclusions lands
one on the brink of an intellectual abyss frightful to
contemplate. He escapes with acrobatic agility where
in all reason he ought to fall, and would fall, if his
passion did not sustain him; where certainly calmer
men must fall.[1]

In addition to De Maistre, there was Lamennais--a
philosopher rather than a theologian; clever, acute,
impassioned, rhetorical; a sort of French Tertullian.
In profound mistrust of human reason, he threw himself
with emotional violence into the work of exalting
authority as the one refuge and salvation against error.
Unbalanced and extreme in all he did, he ended in an
equally violent reaction against the very authority
which he had laboured to exalt. But the moral of the
change was lost upon his countrymen. Scandalised by
his apostasy, they clung to his earlier ideals, and continued
to maintain what the master had forsaken.
He lived in discredit and died in distress, after mournfully
witnessing the wide extension of an Extremist
school, which he had devoted his best years to create,
but was totally unable to restrain.

3. A third important factor was the <i>political pressure</i>
exerted by the French Government upon the Church.

[Footnote 1: <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i> (1858), p. 630. Cf. Lenormant's opinion of
Joseph de Maistre: "Il avait plus de talent que de science, et surtout de
bon sens, et pour ma part, je ne me rangerai jamais parmi ses disciples."--<i>Les
Origines de l'Histoire</i>, i. p. 67, <i>n.</i>]
-----File: p154.png--------------------------------------------------------
The influence of Napoleon promoted the very last
thing he desired, "for a Church, pinched, policed, and
bullied by the State, was inevitably thrown back upon
the support of the Papacy."[1]

From this despotic treatment at home the Church
naturally turned its eyes towards Rome. Rome, with
its troubles and misfortunes, grew more dear. A whole
school of deeply religious and saintly men arose in France,
filled with enthusiastic devotion to the See of Peter.
Lacordaire--whether defending the cause of religious
education, or submitting himself to an adverse decision
from Rome when his master Lamennais broke away,
or re-establishing the order of Dominicans in France,
or advocating the papal authority in the Cathedral
at Paris--produced an immense effect in enlisting the
sympathies of men with Rome. The gifted Montalembert,--eloquent,
imaginative, threw the weight of his power
and high position into the papal cause, and became
among laymen recognised leader of Roman interests.
The great Bishop Dupanloup, warmest-hearted of men,
impulsively gave the movement an indiscriminating
blessing, and brought upon himself numerous expressions
of papal gratitude.

None of these were far-sighted men; none of them
realised in the least the ultimate drift of the authority
they so powerfully advanced. Lacordaire died before
the question of Infallibility came within the council
chamber of the Church; but Montalembert and Dupanloup
alike beheld the prospect with consternation,
and expressed their vehement disapproval.

<tb>

4. Another element which is said to have contributed to
make the French priests as a body largely Ultramontane
was the despotic power of the French Episcopate. Prob-*

[Footnote 1: Cf. Cambridge Modern History. <i>French Revolution</i>, ix. p. 771.]
-----File: p155.png--------------------------------------------------------
*ably no Bishops in Christendom were such autocrats as
the French. The account given by the French statesman
Ollivier, which is confirmed from other sources, represents
the ordinary priest as subjected to a virtual slavery. If
the despotic power of the French Bishops over their
priests was to some extent moderated by piety, yet
anxiety to maintain their authority constantly issued in
acts of pitiless severity. The greater portion of the
French priests were dismissible at will, without judicial
process, or adequate opportunity for self-defence.
Ollivier considers the causes of dismissal to have
been frequently quite insufficient. One Bishop alone
removed one hundred and fifty priests in a single
month, and the State declined to interfere. Under
these circumstances the Pope intervened. He took the
part of the priests against the Bishop, and asserted the
right of the inferior clergy to appeal to himself. From
that moment, says Ollivier, Ultramontanism, hitherto
forlorn enough, pervaded the mass of the priesthood.
Down-trodden by a Gallican Episcopate, the priest
hastened to proclaim the infallibility of a Pope by
whom his own superiors might be the more effectively
controlled. Ultramontanism grew to be a passion in
the clerical world. And this movement from beneath
affected the Episcopate. Either they were driven on
by the force of the stream, or left stranded without the
general sympathy. Ollivier says that whereas, in the
past, men spoke of Gallican independence, it became
a commonplace of Vaticanism to speak of French
docility.[1]

<tb>

5. Another impressive step in the direction of Papal
Infallibility was taken in 1854 by Pius IX. when he

[Footnote 1: Ollivier, i. p. 300. See also the anonymous pamphlet, "Pourquoi le
Clergé Français est Ultramontane" (1879).]
-----File: p156.png--------------------------------------------------------
declared the theory that the Blessed Virgin Mary was immaculately
conceived to be a dogma of the Church. This
theory--rejected by St Bernard and by St Thomas, "a
thesis of a theological school of the Middle Ages," opposed
by the Dominican order--was pronounced by Pius, on
his sole authority, not with the concurrence of a Council
of Christendom, to be of faith. And to this decree the
entire Roman Communion submitted. No such act had
occurred in the Church before. And although this act
could bear constructions not involving Infallibility, for
the Gallican might ascribe its validity to the tacit
consent of the Church, yet it powerfully promoted the
Infallibility view; and it was constantly appealed to as
a practical exercise of infallible authority and a justification
for the Vatican Decrees of 1870.

Thus, if the doctrine of the Infallibility of the Church
as opposed to that of the Pope was formerly the prevalent
belief in France, as the independence of the
Church of France diminished, the authority of Rome
increased. The pressure of episcopal authority over
the priests led the latter to magnify the distant authority
of the Pope as a balance to local control; and while
the Bishops resented, the priests desired an increase of
papal power. Meanwhile the Roman See, wherever
practicable, filled places of influence with Ultramontanes.
The whole weight of the Jesuit teaching was thrown
unitedly, persistently, and with tremendous force, in all
these schools into the scale of Infallibility.

CHAPTER XII

DARBOY, DUPANLOUP, MARET, GRATRY, AND
MONTALEMBERT


The Archbishop of Paris in 1870 was Mgr. Darboy.
The records of his See had been recently a series of
ghastly tragedies. His immediate predecessors were
Quélen, Affre, Sibour, and Cardinal Morlot. Only the
last had died a natural death. Affre was shot on the
barricades, and Sibour assassinated by one of his own
priests. Darboy himself was destined to be added to
the same terrible list. He was shot in prison during the
Commune in 1871. His religious sympathies were the
reverse of Ultramontane.

/#
"By his early theological training, by mental tendencies,
and not less by the traditions of the Diocese and
See of Paris, Mgr. Darboy," says a biographer, "was
devoted to the ancient principles of the Church of
France."[1]
#/

Darboy strove to maintain the ancient rights and
authority of the Episcopate, and made no secret of his
repugnance to--nay, he openly rejected--the theory that
the Roman Pontiff possessed direct and immediate
authority over every separate diocese. And, while he
was a strong supporter of the Pope's temporal power,

[Footnote 1: Guillermin, p. 124.]
-----File: p158.png--------------------------------------------------------
he held to the time-honoured principle, that no papal
document could be published in France without State
permission. His great position and remarkable gifts of
caution and self-control made him a power to be
reckoned with, whether in France or at Rome. In the
Vatican he was disliked and feared, as one of the
strongest obstructors to Ultramontane conceptions.
Napoleon III., who appointed him Archbishop, requested
Pius IX. to raise him to the Cardinalate. The Pope
would neither refuse nor consent. But he gave expression
to his disgust in a private letter[1] to Darboy,
rebuking him in the severest terms for holding opinions
injurious to the papal authority. Darboy replied, with
dignity and self-control, that he had no desire to offend.
But he gave no suggestion of any change of mind.
"I avoid argument," he wrote, "because I do not desire to
argue with a superior on the basis of a letter containing
inaccurate statements of fact, and imparting to me words
which I have not spoken." This was in the autumn
of 1865.

In the June of 1867 the Archbishop went to Rome in
order to bring about an understanding. Shortly after
his arrival he had an audience with the Pope. The
audience began with a long and awkward silence,
interrupted at length by Darboy, who observed that he
was ready to hear the Pope's orders, unless the Pope
preferred that the Archbishop should speak first. Pius
then requested Darboy to speak, which he did, explaining
at considerable length the position of things in
his diocese. Pius expressed himself contented; and
Darboy returned to Paris, where he gave an account
of this interview to his assembled clergy, to whom he
was closely united both in opinion and sympathy.

[Footnote 1: 26th October 1865.]
-----File: p159.png--------------------------------------------------------

However, the incident was by no means closed. In
August 1868 the Pope's letter of 1865 appeared in
a Canadian newspaper, and was shortly copied and
circulated all over France. The effect of the publication
of one of the severest rebukes which a modern
Bishop has received from Rome was naturally injurious
to the Archbishop's authority. Darboy expostulated
with Cardinal Antonelli. His explanations to the Pope,
he said, appeared sufficient, if not complete. At any
rate, no further allusion to the subject had been made
in subsequent correspondence with the Holy See.
Darboy had left Rome with the impression that an
understanding was secured, or the subject set aside.
And behold, suddenly the letter of 1865 had been
drawn out of its privacy and thrown into full publicity.
Now, since the letter was highly unfavourable, it was
clear that the publication was not his doing. The
act did not look like courage, and had all the drawbacks
of indelicacy.

Antonelli replied diplomatically that the incident
was very regrettable, especially since the motives
prompting this exposure could hardly be described as
they deserve. But, while concurring in the Archbishop's
condemnation of the act, he was bound to add that
the Pope was innocent of it and in no way responsible.
Darboy considered this to be an extremely unsatisfactory
evasion, and wrote again, indicating that
suspicion attached to certain officials. Antonelli
answered that the officials entrusted with correspondence
at Rome were above suspicion. He admitted,
however, that the Nuncio at Paris received a copy of
the letter, with permission to show it to the French
Minister of Worship in case of necessity. It was not,
however, likely that he had availed himself of this
permission, or that he had been so indiscreet as to
-----File: p160.png--------------------------------------------------------
publish it. Antonelli suggested that possibly the
perpetrator was an ecclesiastic resident in Paris; but
how a copy of the Pontifical letter could have been
secured, he was unable to explain.

Expostulations from the French Government failed
in eliciting any less unsatisfactory reply. Vague
suspicions and unproved possibilities were all that
the Archbishop received. No real apology was ever
given; no attempt made to repair the mischief done.
But sincere relations of mutual confidence between
the Archbishop and the Holy See were made from
that time forward exceedingly difficult. It appears
that Manning was commissioned at Rome to intervene.
He visited Paris in the autumn of 1868, and assured
Darboy of the Pope's "paternal sentiments" towards
him. He suggested that a conciliatory overture from
the Archbishop would be well received at Rome.
Darboy declined. After Napoleon's advocacy of his
claims to the Cardinalate any such step would seem
nothing better than the promptings of self-interest.
Thus the Archbishop reserved unimpaired his freedom
of expression. Before leaving Paris, to attend the
Vatican Council, he gave utterance to his convictions
once again, in a pastoral letter to his Diocese.[1] Dealing
with disquieting anticipations of coming dogmas; new
articles, likely to be imposed on Catholics, which hitherto
no man had been required to believe; assertions that
the minority would be treated as an opposition, and
speedily suppressed; Darboy seized the opportunity
of re-affirming the ancient principles:--

/#
"If the Ecumenical Council orders explicit belief in
matters hitherto open to denial without charge of
heresy, it must be because these matters were already
#/

[Footnote 1: <i>Eight Months at Rome</i>, Appendix, p. 268.]
-----File: p161.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
certain and generally acknowledged. For in these
questions, Bishops are witnesses who testify, not authors
who discover. The conditions essential to an article
of faith are: that it be revealed by God; and that it
be contained in the Deposit which the Christian
centuries have faithfully guarded and transmitted one
to another without alteration. Now it is incredible
that five or six hundred Bishops will affirm in the
face of the world that they have found in the convictions
of their respective Churches that which is not
there. If, then, they propose in Council truths to be
believed, it is because these truths already exist in
the evidence of Tradition, and in the common instructions
of Theology; and thus that they are not something
new."
#/

What Darboy meant by these guarded words, and
what his clergy understood him to mean, is beyond
dispute. The theory of Papal Infallibility was not
contained in the traditions of the Diocese and See of
Paris. The contrary theory had prevailed. The Archbishop
went to Rome with a full intention of saying
so--and he said it.

When Darboy arrived in Rome, he was speedily
admitted to an audience with the Pope. He was one
of the few to whom this privilege was given. The
Pope had decided not to give special audiences before
the Council assembled. But the Archbishop of Paris
could not well be left out. The very security and
existence of the Council depended, humanly speaking,
entirely on the goodwill of France. Accordingly the
Archbishop of Paris had to be received. It was a
difficult interview. Darboy complained of the publicity
given to the letter of 1865, which, being confidential,
ought never to have been yielded to general curiosity,
by persons surrounding the Pope. Moreover, the letter
contained inaccuracies and errors. The Archbishop
-----File: p162.png--------------------------------------------------------
said that he had refrained from a public defence, partly
from reluctance to correct the assertions of his spiritual
chief, partly because such defence would be open to
misconstruction as prompted by personal ambition.

The Pope, who thoroughly appreciated the allusion
in these last words, replied sympathetically; adding
that he would not henceforth believe any accusation
against the Archbishop. He also expressed his gratitude
for the security which the Imperial protection afforded
him.

2. Dupanloup, Bishop of Orleans, was in the year 1868
at the height of his reputation. No warmer advocate of
papal rights existed in France. In youthful fervour he
had written a thesis on behalf of Infallibility, a theory,
however, which he had long since abandoned in favour
of the French traditional view. That which more than
anything else had confirmed this reversion to history
was the issue of the Syllabus of 1864, which was to
his mind a republication of obsolete mediævalism, most
unsuited to the requirements of modern thought. For
Dupanloup was in keen sympathy with modern ideas;
and this example of the possible exercise of unlimited
authority discouraged and alarmed him, as indeed it
did most of the leaders of the Church in France. With
this disconcerting fact before their eyes, nothing could
be further from their desires than to extend an authority
already so imprudently exerted. Distrust of infallible
pretensions, decided preference for the older Gallican
theory, accordingly, widely prevailed.

Dupanloup had no suspicion that the Vatican Council
would determine the doctrine of Papal Infallibility. He
was able, so late as 1868, to write to the clergy of his
diocese a glowing, re-assuring letter on the coming
assembly. It is an affectionate pastoral utterance, whose
logical cohesion must not be too closely inspected. He
-----File: p163.png--------------------------------------------------------
is persuaded that all is well, and he says so in various
forms. He assures his clergy that, according to Catholic
principles, Bishops united in council with the Pope
"decide questions as witnesses of the faith of their
Churches, as judges by Divine right." He is convinced
that this traditional principle will be maintained.
Catholics have no cause to fear. A Council is a sublime
union of authority with liberty. This will be illustrated
in the coming events in Rome. He appeals with impassioned
eagerness to the separated Eastern Churches,
and to the Protestant communities, to seize this golden
occasion for unity. In his glowing vision the Council is
invested with all the graces of considerateness and
caution: it becomes the means of re-uniting Christendom--a
work of pacification and of light.

The condition of the Church in France at the time
when the assembling of the Vatican Council was proclaimed
may be partly ascertained from some extremely
important and trustworthy sources.[1] Cardinal Antonelli
sent a circular to the Nuncios in December 1868, asking
for periodical reports on the attitude of Governments
towards the Council; on the conduct of Bishops relative
to the same; on the general bearing of non-Catholics;
on the opinions of the Press, books and pamphlets
issued upon the subject; and on the desires and requirements
of each country. The Apostolic Nuncio in Paris
induced four ecclesiastics privately to undertake this
task, and a careful and elaborate memoir was the result.
The report states that the section of the Press
commonly called Ultramontane, such as the <i>Monde</i>
and the <i>Univers</i>, wrote on the Council daily, but offended
many by their general tone and the length to which
they went.

The French clergy are described as pious and reciting

[Footnote 1: Cecconi, iii. p. 187.]
-----File: p164.png--------------------------------------------------------
their breviaries, but in education poor. As to the
general condition in France, Catholics are divided into
two classes: Catholics pure and simple, and liberal
Catholics. These latter are the object of preference
to the Government. They fear that the Council will
proclaim the dogmatic Infallibility of the Pope. The
assertion circulates that if the Pope is declared infallible
it will be necessary to change the language of the
Creed from "I believe in the Church" to "I believe
in the Pope." But the great majority of Catholics
submit by anticipation to whatever the Council may
proclaim. They admire the courageous convocation
of the Council in such stormy, revolutionary times.
They do not conceal from themselves that the Sovereign
Pontiff, by a sentiment of august reserve, may not desire
to take the initiative in a matter affecting him so
personally. But they hope that the Fathers of the
coming Council will define it by acclamation. This
report was sent privately by the Paris Nuncio to
Cardinal Antonelli in Rome. To the astonishment of its
four compilers, it appeared, substantially, shortly after,
in the pages of the <i>Civilta Cattolica</i>, the more or less
official Roman journal under Jesuit influence. This
discovery that they were being merely utilised as
reporters for an Italian magazine, and that their confidential
communications were published in print, under
the heading "Correspondence from France," so disgusted
the compilers that the Nuncio had to tell Antonelli that
they declined to continue. They feared, not unnaturally,
that recognition of authorship in France might lead
to serious results for themselves. This article led to
an able French reply,[1] which accused the Roman
publishers of having printed exclusively in the interests
of the Ultramontanes, and of eliminating everything

[Footnote 1: By Emile Ollivier.]
-----File: p165.png--------------------------------------------------------
adverse to the designs of a certain party in the Church.
They had issued in this Italian magazine an Ultramontane
manifesto by no means concurrent with the
material of the original report. The article in the
<i>Civilta Cattolica</i> does not, said the critic, report what
actually exists in France, but what Rome desires to
find existing. France and its Government are persuaded
that the opinion of sole Papal Infallibility is not accepted
by the vast majority of French clergy, whether priests
or bishops; and they have the right to hope that the
Church in council assembled will have the wisdom
to avoid the theme.

But this pronouncement of the Italian journal filled
Dupanloup with consternation. The high position of
the journal was beyond dispute. The vast distinction
between its definite and extravagant utterances and
the vague generalities of the Pope's own statement was
equally obvious. And yet, situated as they were in
Rome, could the editors have dared to publish such
assertions if entirely destitute of official recognition?
Dupanloup's grief was great. Yet for a time he was
silent. Meanwhile a storm of controversy broke out.
Writings for and against Infallibility appeared in all
directions.

The Ultramontane doctrine was defended by
Dechamps, Archbishop of Mechlin, afterwards appointed
by the Pope Primate of Belgium.[1] The
Belgian Episcopate was small but united; only six
attended the Vatican deliberations. But they were
altogether Ultramontane, being appointed direct from
Rome. Dechamps defended the theory of Papal
Infallibility chiefly on <i>à priori</i> grounds. He maintained
that a doctrinal authority, Divinely established,
<i>ought</i> to be infallible. Unless it makes this claim,

[Footnote 1: May 1869.]
-----File: p166.png--------------------------------------------------------
such authority cannot be Divinely established. For
that which may deceive us, or leave us in error,
cannot be Divine. He endorsed the principle of De
Maistre, that Infallibility is a necessary consequence
of supremacy. One who pronounces absolute dogmatic
decisions, and addresses them to all the faithful and
the entire Catholic Episcopate, without requesting the
consent, either direct or indirect, of the Episcopate,
but rather commanding them to publish and carry
out his decisions, forbidding them to infringe them, or
rashly oppose them, under penalty of <i>de facto</i> excommunication,
is personally infallible. Otherwise his
dogmatic constitutions are a tyrannical usurpation of
the rights of the Episcopate. And, since Dechamps
does not admit the possibility of the latter alternative,
he reaches quite satisfactorily his own conclusion.

Thus, to the Archbishop's mind, the Infallibility of
the Holy See is an indisputable truth, based on revelation,
contained in the written and traditional Word of
God. It is inseparably bound up with truths which
are of faith. Venturing into the department of history,
the author believes that Pope Honorius miscalculated,
through inability to foresee the results of his diplomatic
endeavours, but committed no theological error. He
insinuates a suspicion that the Greeks have falsified
the Acts of the Sixth Council. They have so often
done this sort of thing. During the first fourteen
centuries the Infallibility of the Papal See was, according
to Dechamps, never called in question. That
Bishops opposed the Pope, he admits. But only those
who sided with the Pope constituted the Church. The
doctrine is, he assures his readers, incontestably Catholic.
A man can be a heretic in the sight of God without
being so in the sight of the Church. He is a heretic
if he rejects a truth which he knows to be revealed
-----File: p167.png--------------------------------------------------------
although not defined. There is to Dechamps only
one truth in all the Gospel affirmed with the same
superabundant clearness as Papal Infallibility, and that
is the real presence in the Eucharist. Do not therefore
let us hesitate to define this truth, which forms the
basis of the Divine constitution of the Church--a truth
which Scripture conclusively reveals, and which twenty
centuries have glorified.

This treatise was highly commended at Rome. Pius
himself congratulated Dechamps on the sagacity and
erudition with which he had refuted the cavils of
opponents.

3. Then Mgr. Maret, Bishop of Sura, published his
book: probably the most measured, learned, and conciliatory
statement of the ancient doctrine which the
French Church had seen since the days of Bossuet.

Maret's two scholarly volumes were not written for
the multitude. They could only appeal to the few.
They form a long historical treatise on the relation
between the Papacy and the Episcopate. History, as
understood by Maret, shows in the Church a monarchy
limited by an aristocracy: a Pope regulated by Bishops.
The jurisdiction of the Episcopate is not derived from
the Papacy but from Christ. Maret disclaims any
intention of diminishing the real prerogatives of the
Apostolic See:[1] but he is bound to assert historic truth.
History shows that there were Bishops in the early
Church who did not derive their jurisdiction from
St Peter. If Antioch can be traced to him, the Asiatic
Churches are traced to St John. It can be proved
that numerous Bishops have held their mission neither
directly nor indirectly from the Roman See. Their
institution is not by Divine right an exclusive papal
prerogative.

[Footnote 1: Maret, <i>Le Concile</i>, ii. p. 9.]
-----File: p168.png--------------------------------------------------------

Episcopal jurisdiction being direct from Christ, all
Bishops assembled in council possess an equal right.
The Infallibility of the Church is collective, not
individual; not to be sought in the isolated utterances
of the one, but in the concurrent testimony of the
entire Episcopate. Bellarmine, the leading advocate of
the opposite school, is implicated by his theory, according
to Maret, in insoluble difficulties. For he admits
that, for an utterance to become infallible, there are
certain conditions to be fulfilled, such as serious and
prolonged reflection and consultation with the Pope's
advisers. If these were neglected the result would be
insecure. But, conscious that this conditional Infallibility
diminishes its worth, Bellarmine asserts that an
ill-advised definition is impossible; since the Almighty,
having willed the end, must also will the means. The
precarious character of such <i>à priori</i> constructions is
to Maret sufficiently self-evident. The scriptural
evidence points the other way. Our Lord, says Maret,
did not cause His prayer to preserve St Peter from
a lamentable defect of faith: for God respects man's
freedom. At the most solemn hour in all time--that
when the mystery of universal salvation was being
accomplished--the chief of the Apostolic College denies
his Master thrice. If he quickly recovered, wept bitterly,
and grew deeper in love, the analogy would be, not
the preservation of his successors from defects of faith,
but their speedy recovery; that inconsistencies in papal
decisions should be transient, and not permanently
affect their loyalty to the truth. Whatever may be
said about the letter of Honorius, what is absolutely
certain is that he did not strengthen his brethren.
Often in the Councils of the Church a papal utterance
has been placed before the Bishops. If this utterance
were in itself infallible, the only reasonable attitude
-----File: p169.png--------------------------------------------------------
would be passive obedience and blind submission.
This is not the attitude of true judges, such as the
Bishops have been traditionally regarded.

Maret complains that the doctrine that Infallibility
resides in the Collective Episcopate is sometimes disparaged
as Gallican; whereas it is by no means
restricted to the Church of France, although it possesses
there its principal exponents. Modern Ultramontanism
is to Maret a lamentable phenomenon, greatly promoted
by the ill-regulated influence of such extremists
as Lamennais and Joseph de Maistre. It involves
a treatment of history which but for <i>à priori</i> theories
would be inconceivable.

In the midst of this increasing storm Dupanloup
wrote, in reference to his former vision: "Ah! I had
drawn an ideal of a Council full of charity, zeal, and
love: and behold, all of a sudden appears a scene of
lamentable disputes." But still he published nothing
until Manning's Pastoral appeared, and that provoked
him to public protest. It was November 1869 when
Dupanloup circulated his <i>Observations</i>, and into its
pages he put his whole mind and heart.

It was natural, said the Bishop to his clergy, that
filial piety should desire to adorn a father with all gifts
and all prerogatives; but, congenial as these instincts
were to filial piety, the definition of a dogma demanded
other considerations than sentiment. Journalism, in
the pages of the <i>Civilta[**Civiltà?] Cattolica</i>, had assumed the
right to anticipate theological decisions; and declarations
of faith in the personal and separate Infallibility
of the Pope were being elicited from the most simple-minded
and unqualified. It was actually being taught--the
reference is to Manning--that the Pope was
infallible "apart from the episcopal body whether united
or dispersed." In reply to these extremists, Dupanloup
-----File: p170.png--------------------------------------------------------
did not reject the doctrine categorically: he confined
himself to the assertion that its definition was inopportune.
Yet he marshalled such an array of difficulties
and objections as to imply much more than the
inopportuneness of definition.

Dupanloup declares that he cannot believe that
Pius IX. has assembled the Council to define his own
Infallibility. This was never mentioned in the Pope's
address as one of the grounds for its convocation. The
purpose, according to Pius IX., was to remedy the existing
evils in the Church and in social life. Was it
credible, asked Dupanloup, that in the midst of the
many urgent problems here suggested and implied, a
novel, unexpected, and profoundly complex and thorny
question was to be thrown in the way, to ruin the
prospects of unity, and to provide the world with
scenes of a painfully discordant type? Doubtless, he
continued, men would assure him that a principle was
at stake:--

/#
"A principle!" echoed Dupanloup; "even granting
that were so, I answer, Is it then essential to the life
of the Church that this principle should become a
dogma of faith? How, then, explain the fact that the
Church has lived for eighteen centuries without defining
a principle essential to her existence? How explain
the fact that she has formulated all her doctrine, produced
her teachers, condemned all heresies, without this
definition?"
#/

Accordingly the Bishop denies that there can be
any necessity. It is the Church which is infallible, he
says, and the Infallibility of the Church has been to
this hour sufficient for all religious needs. Dupanloup
earnestly recalled the Ultramontanes to earlier principles
which long prevailed in Christendom. The principle to
be observed in defining doctrine is that given by Pius IV.
-----File: p171.png--------------------------------------------------------
to the Council of Trent: Let nothing be defined without
unanimous consent. Dupanloup remembers well that
when he was in Rome, in 1867, Pius IX., in discussing
the projected Council, was most solicitous that subjects
which might divide the Episcopate should not be
brought before it. And in a recent reply to some
English ministers as to terms of reunion, the Pope had
spoken of papal supremacy, but not a word of Infallibility.
If certain journalists still proclaim this theory
and expect to intimidate the Bishops into silence,
Dupanloup's reply is, They neither know Pius IX. nor
the Episcopate.

Dupanloup's transparent sincerity none will doubt.
But in face of the facts at our disposal, it is singular
that he was so little able to read the signs of
the times, or to estimate the forces at the disposal of
the Infallibilist party. It is clear that he proposed to
go to Rome totally ignorant of the issues before him,
frankly disbelieving that Infallibility would come within
conciliar discussion. It is clear that whatever service
he had rendered to the papal cause, he was not in the
confidence of Pius IX. But that this doctrine was the
deliberate aim for which the Council was gathered is
probably now a settled conviction with serious students
of history. It is simply incredible that so far-sighted
a Curia as that of Rome was suddenly led by impulse
to the formulation of a dogma most momentous yet
quite unforeseen.

If Dupanloup pronounced the dogma of Papal Infallibility
most inopportune, it was partly because he
understood sympathetically the conditions of religious
life outside the Roman Communion, and knew that
nothing in the world could be less calculated to win.
He wrote most forcibly on the futility of inviting, as
the Pope had done, the Oriental Bishops of the separated
-----File: p172.png--------------------------------------------------------
Churches to attend a Council, while preparing to erect
a higher barrier than ever against their reception. Could
anything, he asks, be less persuasive than this? "There
is already a division between us: we will make it an
abyss. You already deny the Supremacy; we require
you to accept the personal Infallibility!" Dupanloup
is aware that certain recent converts ardently desire
this doctrine. But he knows also Protestants desiring
to become converts whom the doctrine will effectively
repel.

But it is in reference to the difficulties which the
dogma must create within the Communion accepting
it that Dupanloup is, perhaps, most impressive.

1. He sees that grave difficulties must attend the
attempt to distinguish papal utterances which are
infallible from those which are not. What are the
precise conditions of an utterance <i>ex cathedra</i>? It is
generally assumed that all pontifical utterances have
not this character. Does it depend upon external conditions,
such as the person or body to whom it is
directed, whether an individual, a local Communion, or
the Universal Church? Is it subjected to internal
conditions; and if so, what? Must the Pope reflect,
study, pray, take counsel; if so, with whom? Or
need he merely speak? Must his utterance assume a
written form, or will verbal message be enough? Is
the Pope infallible if he addresses the whole Church
but acts under intimidation? And if fear disqualifies
infallible deliverance, does not also perverseness, imprudence,
passion? Or will the partisans of Infallibility
say that the Almighty allows the former, but
miraculously prevents the latter? And will it be easy
to determine what constitutes constraint?

2. Then again he sees historical difficulties in the way.
The definition of Infallibility must be retrospective. If
-----File: p173.png--------------------------------------------------------
the Pope be decreed infallible now, it follows that he
must have been equally infallible from the beginning.
The same character must rest on all decisions across
eighteen centuries complying with the conditions
essential to its exercise. Is the Council to make the
application of the principle to the past, and investigate
this theological field of history. Dupanloup recoils from
the prospect of such investigations; nor is he happy
about their effect upon the doctrine itself. Augustine
taught that, after the judgment of Rome, there remained
the Council of the Universal Church. This affirms the
principle that, after the decision of the Pope, the decision
of the Church is essential to a definition of faith. And
Dupanloup manifestly held the same.

3. But difficulties increase. The Infallibility of the
individual seems inconsistent with the Divinely constituted
function of the Episcopate as judge and witness
to the Faith. The whole principle of the Christian
centuries has been that the collective testimony of the
Episcopate is the ultimate expression in matters of
faith. Bishops, says Dupanloup, are judges as to what
the faith really is. They have always decided in
Councils as true judges. The very expressions affixed
with their signatures prove it. "Ego judicans, ego
definiens, subscripsi." Such was the formula. <i>Was</i>--but
when Dupanloup wrote these sentences he had not
anticipated the introduction of a novel form at the
Vatican Assembly. A change of theory is appropriately
accompanied by a change of phrase. Meanwhile the
Bishop pursues his argument. If Papal Infallibility is
independent of the Episcopate, then the essential prerogative
of the latter would be done away. What
defining power is left for the Bishops to exert? They
can give, we are told, their sentence in the form of a
simple assent. But will they be free to give their assent
-----File: p174.png--------------------------------------------------------
or to withhold it? Not in the least. They will be under
an obligation to assent. But no doctrine would depend
on their assent. For, on the Ultramontane theory, the
Pope's decision would bind all consciences of itself,
independently of all episcopal approbation. But in that
case, how could it any longer be maintained, as it has
been maintained hitherto, that Bishops are real judges
as to what is of faith?

Dupanloup's protest and adverse criticism on the
dogma of Infallibility were delivered, as may readily
be believed, with profound distress, and prompted by
nothing but a painful sense of duty. He says that he
is well aware of the hostile constructions which will
be placed upon his words, of the disloyalty with which
he will be charged. Yet such accusations will be as
untrue as they are unjust.

/#
"I dare to say," he writes, "that the Church of
France has given such proofs of its devotion to Rome
as give it the right to be heard, and the right to be
believed, when it speaks of its attachment to the Holy
See."
#/

And he brings his letter to a close with words of
sanguine expectation, soon to be piteously refuted by
experience.

/#
"I am persuaded that as soon as I have touched
that sacred land, and reverenced the tomb of the
Apostles, I shall feel myself far from the battle in a
region of peace, in a midst of an assembly controlled
by a father and composed of brethren."
#/

Dupanloup, says Quirinus in the well-known <i>Letters
from Rome</i>[**F1:no colon?]--

/#
"attacked the opportuneness with such a powerful array
of testimonies in his famous Pastoral that every one
saw clearly that the doctrine itself was involved, though
#/
-----File: p175.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
he never entered in so many words on the theological
question."[1]

"If Dupanloup says that he does not discuss Infallibility
but opportuneness," observes a shrewd critic[2]
writing against him from Rome, "yet two-thirds of the
letter are directed against Infallibility itself; for if the
errors ascribed to the Popes were historic, such a
definition would not only be inopportune but false."
#/

Why, then, it will be asked, did Dupanloup conduct
his antagonism on the basis of opportuneness rather
than on that of truth? It was simply because the
opponents of Papal Infallibility, the German Episcopate
in particular, refused to commit themselves unanimously
to the latter position. They knew, of course, that they
were greatly in the minority, and they believed that
they could secure a numerical strength on the basis of
opportuneness, which they could not expect on that
of explicit rejection. And in the first instance their
impression was correct. The position served its purpose
for several months. It drew adherents to the opposition.
"It provided waverers with a comparatively
innocent method of resistance."[3] It left an easy loophole
for escape in case the pressure at Rome became
too strong. It gave its advocates immunity from
graver accusations, to which they would be liable if the
doctrine were decreed. It would be safer afterwards to
be able to plead, "I did not assert its falsity, I only
thought it inopportune."

But however much the plea of the inopportune might
increase at the beginning the party's numerical
strength, it involved it ultimately and fundamentally
in the most incurable weakness. The plea of inoppor-*

[Footnote 1: <i>Letters from Rome</i>, p. 255.]

[Footnote 2: Nardi in Cecconi, iv. p. 544.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Letters from Rome</i>, p. 255.]
-----File: p176.png--------------------------------------------------------
*tunism is in the long-run an untenable plea. As
Quirinus says:--

/#
"A minority may be invincible on the ground of
dogma, but not on that of expediency. Everything
can be ventured to oppose a false doctrine, but not to
hinder an imprudent or premature definition of a truth."[1]
#/

It laid them open to Manning's retort, "When was
it ever inopportune to proclaim the truth?" It was
the acid of such criticism which dissolved the apparent
unity of the opposition. For it challenged the minority
to say outright whether they believed the doctrine or
denied its truth. And to do the latter in Rome under
such conditions was no easy thing. Here was the
fatal weakness by which the opposition came to grief.
We may wonder what might have been the course of
events had the opposition taken the bolder and stronger
line.

Dupanloup knew perfectly that the publication of
these searching criticisms on the doctrine proposed
involved nothing less than the sacrifice of his popularity
among the entire Ultramontane section of his Church.
That however he could bear with comparative equanimity.
Popularity had come to him: he never sought
it. But what distressed him greatly was that his action
would sadden Pius IX. True that the Bishop expressly
confined himself to the question of opportunism, and
that he pledged himself beforehand to accept the
Council's decisions, whatever those decisions might be.
Nevertheless, in his memorable words, "I go as a
judge and a witness of the faith," he had formulated
a conception of the episcopal function which was not
only ancient and world-wide, but irreconcilable with
the theory of Papal Infallibility.

[Footnote 1: Page 256.]
-----File: p177.png--------------------------------------------------------

It was Dupanloup's great desire to be supported by
Newman's teaching and authority; and to be accompanied
by him as his theologian at the Council in
Rome. Newman, however, says Thureau Dangin,[1]
declined a proposal which he felt would displease
Pius IX. But the Bishop had Newman's perfect
sympathy. The clergy of the diocese sent him
assurances of loyal devotedness. Montalembert wrote
in fervid terms of admiration. And Gratry's famous
incisive letters on the controversy added much to the
intellectual support of Dupanloup's work.

Dupanloup's public declaration of opposition roused
on every side the strongest emotions. Louis Veuillot,
journalist, the extreme of Ultramontanes, editor of the
<i>Univers</i>, declared this attack to be "most unexpected,
and more important than any, owing to the position
of its author."[2] It was to his mind much more serious
than the efforts of Döllinger. The Catholic Bishop had
provided poisonous arguments for an infidel press.
Dupanloup penned impulsively a vigorous and impassioned
reply, in which he applied to the journalist
the title given in the Apocalypse to Satan--the accuser
of the brethren. He could have tolerated Veuillot's
personalities, but not his doctrinal exaggerations. From
dogmatic assertions of the crudest extremest kind,
which had appeared in his pages during the previous
year, the Bishop selected the following examples:
Veuillot declared that Ecumenical Councils never had
so much authority as the Decrees of the Holy See.
Dupanloup asks whether that applies to the Nicene
proclamation of the Divinity of Christ. Veuillot mis-*interpreted
the text "Lo, I am with you always"--you
collectively (for it is in the plural) into you singular--that
is, "you, the Pope." He further declared that when

[Footnote 1: <i>Correspondant</i>, 10th February 1906.]

[Footnote 2: Cecconi, iv. p. 483.]
-----File: p178.png--------------------------------------------------------
the Pope thought God thought in him; that the Pope
represented God on earth; that to the Pope applied
the text, "This is my God and I will praise Him,
my Father's God, and I will glorify Him." Veuillot
further declared that God would stone the human race
with the débris of the Vatican.

Whether one who perpetrated these eccentricities
of doctrine and interpretation and prediction could be
trusted as a qualified exponent of Catholic truth was
to Dupanloup more than manifest. But nevertheless
Veuillot was in France an accredited leader of the
Ultramontanes, a fervid champion of Papal Infallibility.

Dupanloup's courageous attitude enlisted the devoted
admiration of opponents of Papal Infallibility. No
one testifies to this more forcibly than Montalembert.
Montalembert--who curiously combined a profound
belief in mediæval legend with the advanced opinions
of the liberal politician, denying the Church's right to
employ coercive measures, which Rome maintains, yet
advocating vigorously the temporal claims of the Papacy--was
a Catholic of the ancient type: the born antagonist
of the modern Ultramontane, while yielding to
none in devotion to the Roman See. But his admiration
for Dupanloup's outspoken words was unbounded.

/#
"No doubt," wrote Montalembert, "you greatly admire
the Bishop of Orleans, but you would admire him vastly
more if you could realise the depth into which the
French clergy has sunk. It exceeds anything which
would have been considered possible in the days when
I was young.... Of all the strange events which the
history of the Church presents, I know none which
equals or surpasses this rapid and complete transformation
of Catholic France into a vestibule of the ante-*chambers
of the Vatican."[1]
#/

[Footnote 1: Lord Acton, <i>Vatican Council</i>, p. 58.]
-----File: p179.png--------------------------------------------------------

4. To Dupanloup's support came Gratry, priest of the
Oratory, member of the Academy, Professor of Moral
Theology at the Sorbonne. Gratry is certainly one of
the most attractive personalities of the period. A
refined and beautiful character, tender and sympathetic;
he combined, as a contemporary acknowledged,[1] the
imagination of a poet with the gifts of a metaphysician.

Gratry's famous letters attacked the Ultramontanes
on the historical side. It is manifestly essential to the
Infallibilist position that no solitary instance should be
produced of a Pope officially defending heresy. Gratry
therefore took the case of Honorius. "Heretical he cannot
be," said the Ultramontane, as represented by Manning.
"And yet," replies Gratry, "he was condemned
as such by three Ecumenical Councils in succession."

Here is the language of the first of these:--

/*
Anathema to the heretic Cyrus.
Anathema to the heretic Honorius.
Anathema to the heretic Pyrrhus.
*/

Two other Ecumenical Councils repeated this condemnation
of Honorius. The solemn profession of
faith recited by successive Popes for centuries on the
day of their election repeated this condemnation. It
was mentioned in all the Roman Breviaries until the
sixteenth century. Then a significant change took
place. The name of Honorius disappears. They have
simply suppressed his condemnation. These things
are now said otherwise, "for the sake of brevity"!
The <i>Liber Diurnus</i> contained the papal profession
of faith. "As Pope Honorius is condemned in the
profession of faith of the new Pontiffs," says Cardinal
Bona, "it is better not to publish this work." "That

[Footnote 1: Baunard, <i>Hist. Card. Pie</i>, p. 371.]
-----File: p180.png--------------------------------------------------------
is to say," exclaims Gratry, "behold a fact which overwhelms
us. Let us prevent its being known."

The maxim that truth may be suppressed in the
interests of religion roused Gratry's boundless indignation.
Gratry himself had heard an Italian Prelate
defend on this principle the condemnation of Galileo.

/#
"Yes, undoubtedly," said the Bishop, "Galileo was
right, and his judges knew perhaps that he was right;
that he had discovered the true laws of astronomy:
but at that time this too dangerous truth would have
scandalised the faithful. This is the reason they condemned
him, and they did right."
#/

Gratry's strenuous protest is worth recording:--

/#
"Had then the Catholic religion--had the Word of
God--need of this monstrous imposture in a solemn
judgment? O ye men of little faith, of low minds, of
miserable hearts, have not your cunning devices become
the scandal of souls? The very day that the grand
science of Nature dawned upon the world, you condemned
it. Be not astonished if men, before pardoning
you, expect of you a confession, penitence, profound
contrition, and reparation for your fault."
#/

The omission from the Roman Prayer Book of historic
facts acknowledged until the sixteenth century was, to
Gratry's mind, an equally miserable illustration of indefensible
principles. "Never was there in history a more
audacious forgery, a more insolent suppression of the
weightiest facts." The systematic suppression of facts
antagonistic to the Pope's absolute sovereignty and
separate Infallibility ought, urged Gratry, to prevent us
from proclaiming before God and man theories supported
by such a method.

/#
"This was the reason that Dupanloup had spoken.
From God he will receive his reward. And all those
#/
-----File: p181.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
who, notwithstanding these arguments and these facts,
are bold enough to go further and pronounce judgment
in the dark, will have to render an account before the
tribunal of God. Absolute certainty is here a necessity.
For the smallest doubt here demands by Divine right
the most rigorous forbearance."
#/

Louis Veuillot, the journalist, editor of <i>L'Univers</i>,
criticised Gratry with an inimitable mixture of worldly
wisdom, insolent banter, and pious resignation.[1] He
had fondly hoped that Gratry's friends, either by piety
or prudence, would have diverted him from an enterprise
which could only issue in odium or ridicule. However,
needs must that offences come. To deny Infallibility
in presence of a Council met to proclaim the unvarying
faith of the Church, to deny it by attacks on the Prayer
Book, was a masterpiece among mistakes. Nobody
ever accused Gratry of possessing any ecclesiastical
learning or independent power. Loss of faith explains
many things. Needs must that offences come. As
to the contents of the book, it was <i>Janus réchauffé</i>.
Gratry would never convince the human mind with
his Protestant, Gallican, free-thinking ideas. Gratry
is described as being as innocent as a new-born babe,
as having studied nothing, read nothing, but passionately
advocating what others have told him. And
yet this innocence is surprising in an Academician,
formerly of the Oratory, author of a book on logic.
This innocent is, moreover, a priest. Strangers have
brought him papers which say that his Mother has told
him lies; and he takes them for angels and believes
them. But Gratry is also a mathematician; and all
mathematicians have some curious twist in the brain.
Just as Laplace the mathematician had no need of

[Footnote 1: Louis Veuillot, <i>Rome pendant le Concile</i>, p. 156.]
-----File: p182.png--------------------------------------------------------
the hypothesis of God in his world, so Gratry the
mathematician has no need of the hypothesis of the
Pope in his conception of the Church. Gratry ought
to have submitted these angels who instructed him to
the test of holy water. We know these angels of
his. One of them is called <i>Janus</i>. That serpent has
deceived the dove. Gratry has taken Germanism for
science--just as it came from Germany. Inaccurate
mathematician! Incurable infancy!

So Veuillot railed and ridiculed. And Veuillot
obtained letters of papal approval for his defence of
the faith.

Gratry's four letters were read with avidity through
France; they were circulated in Rome, and translated
into English. Four editions appeared in a single year.
They roused the keenest emotions on either side. They
were denounced. They were applauded. Meantime
the shrewd observer wondered what the end would be,
should this controverted opinion become translated into
the province of necessary belief.[1] Episcopal condemnations
were freely issued. The Archbishop of Mechlin
descended to personalities, recommending Gratry to
confine his attention to philosophy, and to cease to
scandalise Christendom with erroneous ideas and outrages
against the Holy See. Another Bishop wrote
in terms which show how profoundly men's passions
were stirred, that the Bishop of Orleans, secretly acting
with an ability worthy of a better cause, had only too
successfully roused both cultured and popular circles,
disturbed the high regions of diplomacy, and attacked
the hopes and convictions of the Catholic world.
Döllinger, Maret, and Dupanloup were a triumvirate
of agitators, to whom was now added that insulter of
the Roman Church, the Abbé Gratry.[2] The Oratory,

[Footnote 1: Cf. Ollivier, ii. p. 57.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Acta</i>, p. 1425.]
-----File: p183.png--------------------------------------------------------
anxious for its safety, repudiated all connection with
its former associate.[1] The unfortunate priest was the
victim of the grossest attacks and suspicions. A few--but
very few--ventured openly to support him. The
Hungarian Prelate, Strossmayer,[2] had the courage to
strengthen him. Strossmayer had read Gratry's defence
of Dupanloup with the greatest joy. Fervid indiscretion
was bringing the gravest perils upon the Church,
and the crisis called for the most energetic resistance.
May Gratry go on and prosper! But such Episcopal
encouragements were few.

On the other hand, the Bishop of Strasburg
endeavoured to suppress the circulation in the usual
mediæval way. He condemned the letters of Gratry as
containing false propositions, scandalous, insulting to the
Holy Roman Church, opening the way to errors already
condemned, rash, and bordering upon heresy. He prohibited
the reading, circulating, or possession of these
letters either by clergy or faithful in his diocese."[3]

5. Montalembert, ruined though he was in health by
an incurable malady, was roused by this reticence
among the men who secretly approved, and came to
Gratry's support. "Since the strong do not support
their own champion," said Montalembert, "the sick
must needs rise from their beds and speak."[4]

/#
"I venture to say that you will not find ... in my ...
speeches or writings a single word in conformity with
the doctrines or pretensions of the Ultramontanes of
the present day; and that for an excellent reason--which
is, that nobody had thought of advocating them
or raising them, during the period between my entrance
into public life and the advent of the Second Empire.

/#
anything favourable to the personal and separate Infallibility
of the Pope such as men seek to impose
upon us."[1]

"How was it possible," wrote Montalembert, "to foresee
in 1847 that the Liberalism of Pius IX., welcomed as
it was by Liberals everywhere, would ever become the
pontificate represented and embodied in such journals
as the <i>Univers</i> and the <i>Civilta</i>? Who could possibly
anticipate the triumph of the theologian-advocates of
absolute power; the novel Ultramontanism, which,
began by destroying our liberties and traditional ideas,
and closes by sacrificing justice and truth, reason
and history, wholesale before the idol which they
have enstated in the Vatican?"[2]
#/

If this word "idol" appears too strong, Montalembert
would appeal to a letter written to him by Mgr. Sibour,
Archbishop of Paris, in 1853.

/#
"The new Ultramontane School," wrote Archbishop
Sibour, "involves us in a double idolatry--an idolatry
of the temporal power, and an idolatry of the spiritual.
When, like myself, you made strong profession of
Ultramontanism, you did not understand things so.
We maintained the independence of the spiritual power
against the exaggerated claims of the temporal. But
we respected the constitution of the State and of the
Church. We did not abolish all grades of power, all
ranks, all reasonable discussion, all lawful resistance, all
individuality, all freedom. The Pope and the Emperor
were not respectively the Church and the State.

"Undoubtedly there are occasions when the Pope
can act independently of all regulations designed for
ordinary procedure; occasions when his power is as
extensive as the needs of the Church.... The older
Ultramontanes were aware of this, but they did not
convert an exception into a rule. The new Ultra-*

/#
*montanes have pushed everything to extremes, and
have argued extravagantly against all independence,
whether in the State or in the Church.

"If such systems were not calculated to compromise
the deepest interests of religion in the present, and
still more in the future, one might silently despise
them. But when one forecasts the evils which they
will bring upon us, it is hard to be silent and to submit.
You have, therefore, done well, sir, to condemn them."
#/

Montalembert's abandonment of the Ultramontanes
is strikingly described by Ollivier, the head of the
Government in France. According to Ollivier, what
Montalembert sought in the Ultramontane propaganda
was simply the removal of civil constraints and the
liberty of the Church. But when men sought to
impose upon him the Infallibilist doctrines of Joseph
de Maistre, whose work he had commended without
understanding, he found that he had unconsciously
promoted the very opinions which he abhorred. The
absolute monarchy of the Pope he simply disbelieved
and rejected. Yet he saw the forces which he had
inspired with enthusiastic devotion to the Papacy
advancing the doctrine of Papal Infallibility. Therefore
he gathered what strength remained, on his dying
bed, in a final protest against any such decree. He
was permitted to die before experiencing the necessity
to submit--<i>Felix opportunitate mortis</i>.[1]

Pius IX.'s own estimate of Montalembert was very
severe. He described him, after his death, as only
half a Catholic, whose mortal enemy was pride.

The Italian historian of the Vatican Council, Cecconi,
Archbishop of Florence, is more just. Cecconi says that
those who knew the deeply Catholic sentiments of
Montalembert, unfortunately entangled though they

[Footnote 1: Ollivier, i. p. 451.]
-----File: p186.png--------------------------------------------------------
were with magnificent Utopias on liberty, will not
credit him with uncatholic extremes. He rendered
to the Church most signal services. If he was
sometimes deceived, this was due, not to want of
intelligence, but of theological learning. When the
alternative lay between liberty and religion, he did
not hesitate. "I love liberty more than all the world,"
he said, "and religion more than liberty." When asked
what he would do if Infallibility were defined, he
answered without hesitation, "I should submit." "But
how would you reconcile your ideas with such a definition?"
"I should impose silence on my reasonings.
If my difficulties remained, assuredly the good God
does not order me to understand, but simply to submit,
as I do to other dogmas." Such was an Italian
estimate.[1]

Dupanloup reached Rome. He found himself, preceded
by a mass of hateful incriminations and ridiculous
calumnies.[2] He was said in English Roman papers
to be in league with Napoleon against the Holy
See.

Dupanloup's generous nature was profoundly wounded.
To the clergy of the diocese who expressed their loyal
sympathy with him, he replied:--

/#
"You see a Bishop who, during a life already long,
has given manifest proofs of his devotion to the Church
and to the Holy See; but who, because one day in a
momentous question he has said what he believed to
be the true interest of religion and of the Papacy,
becomes suddenly the object of all the insults and
indignities against which you protest: so far has
passion prevailed where it ought not to exist. But
what does it matter? There are in life hours marked
out for grave and painful duties."[3]

Dupanloup's house in Rome became a centre of
activity for the Bishops of the minority. He was the
animating spirit of the French opposition, while
Darboy, Archbishop of Paris, was the controlling
influence.[1] The French Episcopate possessed no
unity, and quickly divided into two opposing parts.
Endeavours were made to hold them together. But
the two French Cardinals represented contrary opinions.
Cardinal Mathieu, Archbishop of Besançon, was a
member of the opposition. But his conduct manifested
a lack of qualities essential to a leader. Cardinal
Bonnechose, Archbishop of Rouen, on the contrary,
was a decided Ultramontane. And Pius placed him
on the important Committee of Suggestions. So the
two Cardinals pulled different ways. When Cardinal
Mathieu laboured to unite the Bishops of the French
Church, Cardinal Bonnechose adroitly consulted
Antonelli, who, acting on the maxim "divide and
conquer," advised that the Pope was opposed to meetings
of larger numbers than fifteen or twenty. Cardinal
Mathieu consequently left Rome in disgust, and went
to spend Christmas in Besançon. However, in spite
of great discouragements, an international committee of
the opposition Episcopate was formed, which materially
strengthened their forces.

CHAPTER XIII

OPPOSITION IN GERMANY--DÖLLINGER


Ignatius von Döllinger became Professor at
Munich in 1825. In a mixed University, where Protestant
and Roman teachers addressed their students
in close proximity, and Schelling taught Philosophy
while Möhler lectured on Symbolism, and Klee on the
Fathers, a knowledge of modern thought, an abandonment
of obsolete methods, became natural and necessary
among Roman Catholic advocates. The stricter Italian
School looked with grave misgivings on these Liberal
tendencies and looser ways. But circumstances rendered
this larger freedom more or less inevitable. It is curious
to reflect that Döllinger began life as an Ultramontane,
under the influence of the works of that paradoxical
extremist Joseph de Maistre; for whom Lord Acton
professed a distant regard, coupled with a devout determination
to exclude the contributions of the entire
school from the pages of his journals. Döllinger's
change from the Roman to the Catholic standpoint was
the outcome of independent critical and historical study.
Cold and critical by nature, essentially intellectual,
he was endowed with enormous vigour and insatiable
desire for learning. His intention was to write
a history of the Papacy. He found the approaches
choked with legend. "Many of these were harmless,
-----File: p189.png--------------------------------------------------------
others were devised for a purpose; and he fixed his
attention more and more on those which were the work
of design."[1] The question raised by the mediæval
fables of the Papacy became theologically of grave
concern: "How far the persistent production of spurious
matter had permanently affected the genuine constitution
and theology of the Church?" From the fables,
Döllinger advanced to the forged decretals. He studied
"the long train of hierarchical fictions which had
deceived men like Gregory VII., St Thomas Aquinas,
and Cardinal Bellarmine."[2] "And it was," says Acton,
"the history of Church government which so profoundly
altered his position." Existing ecclesiastical developments
had to be tested by the past; their value
disentangled from the fictitious elements which contributed
to produce them. The famous Canon of
St Vincent of Lerins, the appeal to antiquity, universality,
and consent, came to have increasing worth in
Döllinger's mind. "He took the words of St Vincent,"
says Acton,[3] "not merely for a flash of illumination,
but for a scientific formula and guiding principle." At
first insensibly, but more and more definitely, Döllinger
diverged from the axioms of the Ultramontanes.
Catholic he continued to be throughout, and to the
very last; but historical knowledge seemed to him
impossible to combine with the popular Roman theories
of the day. Under his intellectual rule the Munich
School acquired immense ascendancy. It became the
recognised centre of ecclesiastical learning, Catholic yet
critical. And, above his colleagues, Döllinger became
the adviser of the Church in Germany.[4] Montalembert
attended lectures there, and Acton, rejected at

Cambridge, found a home in Döllinger's house at
Munich.

The theological principles of Ignatius von Döllinger
could scarcely be in the year 1868 unknown in Rome.
For five-and-forty years he had been a teacher in
Ecclesiastical History, and his reputation was European.
But he was not invited to take any part in the theological
preparations for the Vatican Council. An Italian
writer[1] indeed assures us that

/#
"in the number of those whom the Pope intended to
invite was, contrary to the advice of some, the celebrated
historian Döllinger.... But the Sovereign Pontiff was
informed, on the authority of statements perhaps somewhat
inexact, that Döllinger would refuse the invitation;
and accordingly Pius IX. did not give effect to his
intention."
#/

The explanation is unconvincing and superfluous.
The presence of Döllinger on a theological commission
in Rome at the Pope's request is scarcely thinkable.
There were few learned members of the Roman
Communion whom Pius IX. would welcome less
in Rome. But the minority earnestly desired his
presence.[2] Cardinal Schwarzenberg wrote to Antonelli
that the consulting theologians selected for the
preparatory commissions were not, so far as Germany
was concerned, up to the necessary level. Doubtless
their merits were considerable, but their learning was
small. They were not qualified to do justice to the
difficult problems which would have to be submitted
to them. They were chosen, so far as the dogmatic
section was concerned, exclusively from one School.
The Universities of Munich, Bonn, Tübingen, Fribourg,
included many eminent men, who were, however,

[Footnote 1: Cecconi, ii. p. 329.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> li. p. 331.]
-----File: p191.png--------------------------------------------------------
omitted, much to Schwarzenberg's astonishment. He
noted in particular the absence of Hefele and Döllinger.
But while Schwarzenberg wrote in this honest, impulsive
way, Antonelli was in receipt of letters of another type
from the Bavarian Nuncio, Meglia. According to the
Nuncio, among the more hopeful and moderate German
Professors was Dieringer of Bonn, who had been proposed
for three bishoprics, including the Archiepiscopal
See of Cologne. True, he had recently somewhat compromised
his reputation by an attack on the Jesuit
Kleutgen; but the Nuncio regarded this as a momentary
aberration--the general opinion being that at fifty-six
Dieringer was not likely to belie his past. To mix
him with theologians in the Eternal City would place
him more completely at the disposal of the Roman
cause. Another promising person was the historian
Hefele. True, that his History of the Councils contained
some hazardous remarks; but the Nuncio evidently felt
secure of him. "Now," adds Meglia, "it is very noticeable
that no member of the German party of <i>savants</i> has
been invited to Rome, and the result is that they
are in a great state of irritation. It would be, therefore,
prudent to meet this by a careful selection from the
more moderate among them." As a result of this
communication, Pius invited Dieringer, Hefele, and
others: thus, the <i>Augsburg Gazette</i> observed, correcting
the Italian monotony by an infusion of elements
very necessary to give vitality. So Döllinger was left
out. But he was by no means unoccupied. He was
engaged in writing the five articles, criticising and
condemning the Infallibility doctrine from an historical
point of view, which appeared anonymously in March
1869 in the <i>Augsburg Gazette</i>. These articles
attracted a great attention, and were regarded with
profound disgust in Rome. In three months' time
-----File: p192.png--------------------------------------------------------
appeared the volume entitled <i>The Pope and the Council,
by Janus</i>. <i>Janus</i>, as the preface assured the reader,
was the production of several writers; but, as Friedrich[1]
tells us, under Döllinger's control. <i>Janus</i> was an expansion
of the five articles in the <i>Augsburg Gazette</i>.
The purpose of <i>Janus</i> was to demonstrate that, according
to ancient Catholic principles, the chief exponent of
the faith in Christendom was the Collective Episcopate;
and therefore that the Council stood supreme above
the Pope. Leo himself acknowledged that his treatise
could not become a rule of faith until confirmed by
the assent of the Episcopate. The process by which
these principles were reversed is ascribed partly to
the ever-increasing ascendancy of the papal power, to
which in the long development of centuries many things
contributed. The historical evolution was not without
protests and reactions, but forged documents, accepted
by uncritical ages as correct, misled even such theologians
as St Thomas.

Various influences tended to advance the conception
of the Pope's Infallibility. There was the influence of
the theologians after St Thomas, whose great authority
seemed sufficient, but whose opinion was founded on
fictitious documents. There was the influence of
the Inquisition, which, wherever it was dominant,
rendered instruction in the ancient conception impossible.
There was the influence of the <i>Index</i>,
which meant the suppression of criticism and the
conversion of historical literature into partisan productions
for the maintenance of Ultramontane
opinions. The publication of certain books, such
as the <i>Liber Diurnus</i>, containing historic statements
impossible to reconcile with Papal Infallibility,
was prevented, and impressions already printed

[Footnote 1: Friedrich, <i>Döllinger</i>, iii. p. 485.]
-----File: p193.png--------------------------------------------------------
were destroyed, confessedly because they could not
be utilised in the controversial interests of the Italian
theories. Alterations were made in the Breviary in
the direction of Papal Infallibility. The fact that
Pope Honorius had been condemned as a heretic by
Councils was now left out. But more than many
influences, the powerful Order of the Jesuits contributed
to the advancement of the theory. It was congenial
to their whole spirit. Accustomed to the principle of
blind obedience; themselves exhorted and in turn
exhorting others to the sacrifice of the intellect; they
identified themselves with this doctrine, protected it, and
promoted it with tremendous effect. Since the days
of Bellarmine, their theologian, they gave it the benefit
of their entire concurrence.

So then, according to <i>Janus</i>, through the co-operation
of many foreign elements, the ancient principle is found
completely reversed; and whereas in primitive centuries
the Council, the Collective Episcopate, was the supreme
exponent, in the later it was the Pope. This, says
<i>Janus</i>, is no true development. It is rather a transformation.
The verdict of History is against this
doctrine entirely.

/#
"For thirteen centuries an incomprehensible silence
on this fundamental article reigned throughout the whole
Church and her literature."

"To prove the dogma of Papal Infallibility from
Church History nothing less is required than a complete
falsification of it."
#/

The advocates of Papal Infallibility could not avoid
the discussion of the serious problem which their theory
entailed, namely, <i>under what conditions</i> is the Pope
infallible? They found, says <i>Janus</i>, on closer inspection,
papal decisions which contradicted the doctrines either
-----File: p194.png--------------------------------------------------------
of their predecessors or of the Church. <i>Janus</i> gives
numerous instances. It became necessary, therefore,
to specify some distinctive marks by which the product
of Infallibility might be recognised. Accordingly, since
the sixteenth century there grew up the famous view
that papal judgments, when pronounced <i>ex cathedra</i>,
were infallible. The remarks of <i>Janus</i> on this point
ought to be given as far as may be in the writers' words.

The writers acknowledge that "the distinction
between a judgment pronounced <i>ex cathedra</i> and a
merely occasional or casual utterance is a perfectly
reasonable one," not only in the case of a Pope, but
in the case of any teacher. Every teacher will at
times speak offhand, and at times speak officially and
deliberately. "No reasonable man will pretend that
the remarks made by a Pope in conversation are definitions
of faith." But beyond this the distinction has
no meaning. Every official utterance of a Pope must
be an <i>ex cathedra</i> utterance. When a Pope speaks
publicly on a point of doctrine, he has spoken <i>ex
cathedra</i>; for he was questioned as Pope, and has
answered as Pope. To introduce other conditions, such
as whether he is addressing an individual, or a local
Communion, or the entire Church, is to make purely
arbitrary distinctions which are really prompted by
the existence of certain inconvenient papal decisions
inconsistent with the theory of his Infallibility.

This question, "Which of the papal decisions are
infallible?" is indeed momentous to the Roman churchman.
The authors of <i>Janus</i> are profoundly disturbed,
for instance, to know whether the doctrines of the
Syllabus produced under Pius IX. in 1864 are or are
not included among infallible utterances.

No one will now deny that it was an act of discretion
on the part of the authors of this book to produce it
-----File: p195.png--------------------------------------------------------
under the veil of anonymity. They would allow no
opportunity, so the readers were informed, of transferring
the discussion from the sphere of objective and
scientific investigation into the alien region of personal
invective.

The sensation created by its appearance was very
great. The <i>Dublin Review</i>,[1] among other expressions,
declared that the writers of <i>Janus</i> had excluded all
possibility of mistake as to whether they were
Catholics. They had "shown that they are just as
much and just as little Catholics as are Dean Stanley
and Professor Jowett." "Janus is an openly anti-*Catholic
writer." The <i>Dublin Review</i> laid it down
that "the Ultramontane doctrine exhibits certainly
most singular harmony with the whole past course of
ecclesiastical history"; but it manifested considerable
embarrassment in determining what papal utterances
there were which were really issued <i>ex cathedra</i>.
"There have undoubtedly been very many <i>ex cathedra</i>
acts not formally addressed to the whole Church,"
said the <i>Dublin Review</i>, but omitted to add by what
characteristics infallible utterances might be known.
Meanwhile <i>Janus</i> was called an almost incredible
instance of controversial effrontery.

Döllinger's Dublin critic affirmed that--

/#
"in real truth, through the whole post-Nicene period,
Pontifical dogmatic letters issued <i>ex cathedra</i> are no
less undeniable and no less obtrusive matters of
historical fact than are Ecumenical Councils themselves;
they meet the student at every page."
#/

The <i>Dublin Review</i> forms a very low estimate of
the intellectual power exhibited in <i>Janus</i>. According

[Footnote 1: Vol. xiv. <sc>N.S.</sc> (1870), p. 194.]
-----File: p196.png--------------------------------------------------------
to that authority, it was "very difficult to suppose that
so indubitably and extensively learned a man as Dr
Döllinger can be mixed up with so poor and feeble a
production." These criticisms were followed by another
article, entitled <i>Janus and False Brethren</i>. Here the
reviewer fulminates against the writers of <i>Janus</i>.

/#
"There are enemies and traitors in the camp. It is
not from Protestants only, but from men kneeling at
the same altars as himself that the Catholic has to
dread the poisoning of his faith."

"In number indubitably these false brethren constitute
no more than a small and insignificant clique. But they
are energetic, zealous, and restless; and though their
intellectual power is sometimes absurdly overrated,
they comprise one or two really able and learned men
in their number."
#/

The general opinion at Rome was that the book was
certainly composed by the Munich School, and the
immense historical teaching pointed to one individual,
known for his life-long familiarity with Papal history.[1]
Renewed efforts were made by opponents of Infallibility
to induce Döllinger to reside during the Council in
Rome. Cardinal Schwarzenberg did all that lay within
his power. Strossmayer, one of the most eloquent
members of the Council, declared that Döllinger's
presence was urgently necessary. Maret, the learned
author of the volumes defending a modified Gallican
view, entreated Döllinger to overcome his reluctance
and render this service to the Church. "Although
without official place," wrote Maret, "your knowledge
and advice would greatly influence a multitude of unenlightened
and undecided minds." Bishop Dupanloup
thought much the same.

[Footnote 1: Friedrich, iii. p. 489.]
-----File: p197.png--------------------------------------------------------

Döllinger, however, thought otherwise. He came to
the conclusion that he could be of more real service
to the cause through the Press.[1]

Döllinger's massive learning and extraordinary
abilities constituted him naturally the leader in
Germany against the Ultramontane proposals; but it
must never be forgotten that he was only the leader.
Behind him was a vast body of Bavarian and German
approval. Meetings and protests and petitions against
an Infallibility decree sprang up all over Germany.[2]
Munich, Coblentz, Berlin, and many other cities pleaded
vigorously for the older convictions. A very serious
anonymous protest[3] circulated through the Bavarian
Kingdom in May 1869. It solemnly emphasised the
momentous character of the impending conflict. Two
antagonistic principles were engaged in final strife for
supremacy: on the one hand, Papal absolutism; on the
other, the genuine Catholicism. The principles of the
Syllabus declared that the Church had the right to
resort to coercion, and possessed direct power even in
temporal affairs. Liberty of conscience and liberty of
the Press were denied to be human rights. Were these
principles to be erected by Papal Infallibility into
dogmas of faith? Was Christendom to witness the
triumph of absolutism and a new Ultramontane
confession?

<tb>

An address[4] was sent by the Catholics of Coblentz to
the Bishop of Treves, dissociating themselves altogether
from the doctrine of Papal Infallibility.

/#
"A distinguished religious Order is concentrating all
its forces upon this project. To be silent would imply
approval. As Catholics, they feel constrained to protest
#/

[Footnote 1: Friedrich, iii. p. 518.]

[Footnote 2: Documents in Cecconi, iii. p. 312 ff.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 315.]

[Footnote 4: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 326.]
-----File: p198.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
to their Bishop that the ideas and hopes of this party,
who call themselves the only true Catholics, are not and
never can be theirs. The coming Council would do
the Church great service if it would suppress the <i>Index</i>
of prohibited books. To punish the errors of Catholic
writers by placing their names on the <i>Index</i> is neither
worthy of the spirit nor the dignity of the Church, and
is hurtful to the real interests of the advancement of
truth."
#/

This address from the Catholics of Coblentz drew
from the dying Montalembert[1] words of impassioned
admiration. All his old eloquence and fire for a
moment re-appeared. His end, he said, was near. He
believed himself possessed of the impartiality which
is the privilege of death. His body is already a ruin,
but his spirit lives; and he turns with a thrill of joy
to the Catholics of Coblentz. Their protest is sound
from beginning to end. He could willingly endorse
every line of it. His only sorrow is that a similar
spirit does not animate the French; akin to that which
filled them in the first half of the nineteenth century.

The Bavarian Foreign Minister, Prince Hohenlohe[2]
issued enquiries to the Faculties of Theology in the
Bavarian Universities. The Professors were requested
in particular to explain what criteria existed for the
discernment of an infallible decree.

The Faculty of Wurtzburg replied[3] that, so far as
the faithful were concerned, it did not much matter
whether a definition of faith were formulated by the
Pope after consultation with the Bishops (as in 1854)
or by an Assembly of Bishops directed by him. It
is all the same to the individual believer. If one
has to recognise a human authority in matters of faith,

[Footnote 1: Documents in Cecconi, iii. p. 339.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Memoirs</i>, i. p. 328.]

[Footnote 3: Cecconi, iii. p. 479.]
-----File: p199.png--------------------------------------------------------
it is as easy to yield to the decision of one as to
that of a thousand. Which of these two Christ had
ordained, this Faculty did not discuss. They thought,
however, that a kind of Infallibility existed in any
court of final appeal, and must in a manner be possessed
by the Pope. As to the signs whereby an
infallible decree might be distinguished from fallible
utterances, various opinions of theologians were given.
Some maintained that deep and exhaustive study of
Scripture and Tradition was an essential preliminary.
No decree could possess Infallibility unless addressed
to the entire Church. They recognised that if the
coming Council were to define Papal Infallibility, it
would be necessary to make certain modifications in
the Catechisms of the Church; but they did not
consider that the necessary alterations would be very
profound.

The Munich theologians[1] replied in a very different
strain. They said that no certain criticism was universally
acknowledged whereby a decree which was
infallible could be distinguished from those which were
not. Twenty different opinions were held and disputed
about it. If the Council at Rome undertakes
a definition of Papal Infallibility, it had better
determine also the nature and conditions of its exercise.
Otherwise endless disputes and similar insecurity will
remain. The Bavarian Catechisms spoke only of the
Infallible Authority of the Church--that is, of the Pope,
together with the entire Episcopate. There existed
indeed a Jesuit Catechism, recently introduced into
a number of dioceses, which affirmed that the authority
of the Church is expressed either by the Pope or by
a Council approved by him. But this modification
was obviously designed to transfer the privilege of

[Footnote 1: Cecconi, iii. p. 524.]
-----File: p200.png--------------------------------------------------------
Infallibility entirely and exclusively to the Pope.
Manifestly therefore a revolutionary alteration would
have to be made in the diocesan Catechisms if Papal
Infallibility were decreed.

That a doctrine contrary to Papal Infallibility was
being taught as Catholic, under sanction of Episcopal
Authority, in Germany in the first half of the nineteenth
century is indisputable. Liebermann's theological
writings were published in five volumes at Mainz. The
third edition was in 1831. It was first published with
the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Vicar-General of Mainz in 1819.

Liebermann was a distinguished personage in his
day. He became Superior of the Seminary at Mainz
and Canon of the Cathedral, afterwards Vicar-General
of Strasburg. His <i>Institutiones Theologicæ</i>,[1] became
the standard work in many seminaries in France,
Belgium, Germany and America.

Liebermann's doctrine is:--

/#
"It is certain from the principles of the Catholic
Faith that the supreme Pontiff has the chief place
in determining controversies of Faith; and that his
judgment, if the consent of the Church be added, is
irreformable. But whether his judgment is infallible
before the Church's consent is a matter open to
dispute among Catholics without detriment to their
Catholicity."[2]
#/

To this proposition Liebermann adds:--

/#
"Although there are many saintly and learned men
among Catholics, who in their regard for the See of
Peter have taught or still are teaching that the Roman
Pontiff when he speaks <i>ex cathedra</i> cannot err; yet there
have always existed very many other theologians who
have taught the opposite, and these the Church none
the less considers to be pious and earnest defenders
#/

[Footnote 1: Lichtenberger, <i>Encyclopédie des Sciences Religreuses</i>.][**Religieuses]

[Footnote 2: Liebermann, <i>Institutiones Theologicæ</i>, ii. p. 540.]
-----File: p201.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
of the Faith. Therefore, this question is of the number
of those which may be disputed without detriment
to Catholicity."
#/

His conclusion is that:--

/#
"accordingly the Infallibility of the Roman Pontiff
cannot be urged against heretics, nor utilised to
establish the Catholic Faith....[1] Nor can it be
adduced, even by those who are fully convinced of
its truth, as a test principle. For nothing can be
employed as a basis of divine Faith which is not in
itself indisputable. Neither can that be made the
rule of faith which itself forms no portion of the
faith."[2]
#/

The <i>Catechism of the Catholic Religion</i> by Krautheimer,[3]
approved by the Bishop of Mainz in 1845, contains the
following question and answer:--

/#
"Do we believe that, as a consequence of this primacy,
the Pope is infallible and may decide as Christ Himself;
as the non-Catholics allege?

No. The Pope possesses in controversies of faith
only a judicial decision which can only become an
article of faith when the Church gives its concurrence."
#/

This and similarly worded books of instruction had
been recently withdrawn in parts of Germany through
Ultramontane influence, and replaced by a Jesuit
Catechism.

Philip Neri Chrismann was a Franciscan monk, and
reader in Theology and Ecclesiastical History. His
<i>Rule of Catholic Faith</i> was republished at Wurzburg
in Bavaria, with the permission and approval of his
ecclesiastical superiors in 1854. In this work on
Dogmatic Theology he gives an exposition of the
Infallibility of the Church, its nature and restrictions,

[Footnote 1: Page 542.]

[Footnote 2: Page 543.]

[Footnote 3: Page 87.]
-----File: p202.png--------------------------------------------------------
without any reference to the Pope. At the close of
the volume he gives a list of Adiaphora, or things
indifferent, in which he observes that

/#
"although the greatest reverence, obedience and submission
be due to the Supreme Pontiff yet he is not
favoured with the special privilege of inerrancy which
was given by Christ our Lord only to the Church."[1]
#/

Indeed, the majority of the faithful, and above all the
Bishops and clergy, did not share in Germany the Ultramontane
views.[2] The theological faculties of Tübingen
and Munich were firmly attached to the Episcopal conception,
and thereby equally opposed to the autocratic
Roman idea. Hefele at Tübingen had pronounced, as
a historian, hardly less distinctly than Döllinger at
Munich.

Before obeying the summons to attend the Vatican
Council, an <i>Assembly of German Bishops</i> was held at
<i>Fulda</i> (September 1869).[3] Some twenty Bishops were
present. There was Melchers, Archbishop of Cologne,
who presided; there was Döllinger's Diocesan, Scherr,
Archbishop of Munich, well acquainted with the
historian's principles, and no more an Ultramontane
than Döllinger himself; there was Ketteler, Bishop of
Maintz, in whose diocese the recognised Catechism
had for years instructed the faithful to reject Papal
Infallibility, and who became one of the most persistent
opponents of the doctrine to the very last in Rome,
and in the Pope's own presence; there was Conrad
Martin, afterwards an Infallibilist, but at present known
as author of a widely disseminated handbook in which
the doctrine was denied; and there was Hefele, Bishop

[Footnote 3: Cecconi, iv. p. 155.]

elect of Rottenburg, whose <i>History of the Councils</i> told
heavily against the Ultramontanes.

The German Episcopate was under no illusions as
to the introduction of this doctrine into the coming
deliberations in Rome. Accordingly they set other
subjects aside[1] to discuss the question. It was declared
that a question so momentous required the production
of proofs from Tradition; proofs of such a kind as
to satisfy fully the demands of criticism, while leaving
opponents full liberty of speech. They proceeded to
examine the opportuneness of any definition. On the
one side it was declared that Councils hitherto had
only passed decisions on questions of urgent necessity.
Now the present subject presented no such necessity.
There existed no danger, either to the purity of the Faith,
or to the peace of the Church. Viewed relatively to
the Oriental Churches, a definition would be altogether
inopportune. Eastern Christians admit a primacy of
honour, and might be induced to admit a primacy of
jurisdiction. But they hold with such tenacity to the
ancient traditions that it was hopeless to imagine they
would ever assent to Papal Infallibility. The same
consideration holds with reference to Protestants. And
also for the Catholics of Germany the dogma would be
dangerous.

On the other hand, a member of the Assembly urged
that by many people the dogma was desired; that the
opposition must not be exaggerated; that the number
of German Catholics was relatively few; that the promulgation
of the Immaculate Conception dogma already
involved implicitly that of Papal Infallibility.[2]

In the following discussion Bishop Hefele spoke with
strongest emphasis.[3] He had never believed in Papal

[Footnote 1: Cecconi, ii. p. 459.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> iv. p. 160.]

[Footnote 3: Friedrich, ii. p. 190.]
-----File: p204.png--------------------------------------------------------
Infallibility. He had studied the history of the Church
for thirty years; but nothing could be found for Papal
Infallibility in the ancient Church. It could not be
rightly discussed as merely inopportune, for it simply
was not true. These assertions were opposed. Eventually
a petition was sent to the Pope, declaring the
doctrine inopportune by a majority of fourteen Bishops
out of nineteen.[1] Then, as a curiously incongruous
sequel to their own grave anxieties, the Bishops
set themselves to the work of re-assuring the German
Catholics in a Pastoral[2] which declared that an
Ecumenical Council would not impose a new dogma,
a dogma not contained in Scripture and Apostolic
Tradition; that they were confident that no obstacle
would be placed either to the liberty or duration of
discussion in the Council's deliberations. The Pastoral,
said a contemporary writer[3]--

/#
"contains a promise, worded with all the distinctness
that could be desired, that, so far as it depends on the
votes of the German Bishops, the yoke of the new
articles of faith shall not be laid on the German
nation."
#/

When the King of Bavaria read the Pastoral, he
congratulated the Bishops on the line adopted, and
expressed a hope that a similar spirit would prevail
in the approaching deliberations in Rome.[4]

On the other hand, a distinguished Prelate[5] compared
the opponents of Infallibility to the possessed at Gadara;
and described them as crying piteously, "What have we
to do with thee, Vicar of Christ?" No one, he said,
would be deprived of freedom of thought or expression

-----File: p205.png--------------------------------------------------------
in the coming Council. No conflict of opinions would
be there; nor any parties, as in a political assembly.

Döllinger, as <i>Janus</i> shows, was the victim of no
illusions as to the main purpose to which the Vatican
Council would be directed. Whatever impressions
might exist in France or elsewhere, the student of
History did not misinterpret the steady direction of
events, the persistent intention of the dominant
influences in the Church. And, although permitted
no official work among the theologian consultors of
the Council, he placed at the disposal of the Bishops
the conclusions of his historical learning, in his
Considerations respecting the question of Papal
Infallibility.[1]

Döllinger insisted that the principle by which the
Church had been hitherto controlled in matters of
faith was the principle of immutability. To demonstrate
that a doctrine was not the conviction of the
entire Church, that it was not logically included as
an undeniable sequence in the original Deposit of
Revealed Truth, was hitherto regarded as a conclusive
demonstration that such doctrine could never
be raised to the dignity of a dogma of the Church.
Döllinger contended that on this principle the case for
Papal Infallibility was already adversely determined.
In the Eastern Church no voice had ever been heard
to ascribe dogmatic Infallibility to the Pope. The
doctrine did not arise within the West until the
thirteenth century. It renders the history of Christendom
for the first thousand years an incomprehensible
enigma: for history exhibits Christendom toiling by
painful, circuitous methods to secure what, if the Popes
were infallible, might have been gained in the simplest
way, from the utterances of a solitary voice in Rome.

[Footnote 1: See <i>Declarations and Letters</i> (October 1869).]
-----File: p206.png--------------------------------------------------------
Nor is it possible, argued Döllinger, to account for
the transference of infallible authority from the Church
to the Pope, as a process of legitimate development.
The new theory is the negation of the old. The ancient
doctrine was that the Divine guidance is given to the
Church collectively. It is the Church, as a whole,
which cannot fall away. But the Ultramontane theory
reverses this. It asserts that Divine guidance is given
not to the Church collectively, but to one individual
person; that Infallibility is his alone--a prerogative in
which the Collective Episcopate has no share; that from
him alone the Church receives light and truth. This is
not development. It is negation. Among the Scripture
passages to which Infallibilists chiefly appealed was the
exhortation to strengthen his brethren. But this is an
exhortation, not a promise. "It is a violent perversion to
turn an admonition to duty into a promise of the invariable
fulfilment [**P2: fulfillment] of that duty." Still less can this exhortation
be transferred as a promise to his successors, when
it was only a personal admonition. It was, moreover, an
exhortation which Peter himself did not invariably fulfil [**P2: fulfill].
Far from strengthening the Church at Antioch in the
faith, he rather perplexed it by his dissimulation.

Döllinger contended that the historical growth of
belief in the theory of Papal Infallibility was sufficiently
instructive. When proposed to the Council of Trent, it
was withdrawn by the legates who proposed it; because
they recognised that a number of the Bishops disapproved
it. Since that time the influence of the Jesuits and the
Inquisition had steadily extended the theory, for they
made the presentation of any other doctrine in books or
teaching impossible in Italy, Spain, and Portugal. Every
attempt to test the theory by historical criticism had
been put upon the <i>Index</i> and suppressed, with the solitary
exception of Bossuet and Cardinal de la Luzerne.

CHAPTER XIV

HOHENLOHE AND FRIEDRICH


In April 1869 Prince Hohenlohe[1] issued a circular,
composed chiefly by Döllinger, to the Bavarian Legations,
calling their attention to the certainty that
Infallibility would be discussed, and the probability
that it would be passed at the approaching Vatican
Council; and requesting them to consult the various
Governments in which they were located as to the
advisability of some concerted action on the part of
the European Powers. This step was taken on the
ground that the Infallibility of the Pope goes far beyond
the domain of purely religious questions, and has a
highly political character; inasmuch as the power of
the Papacy over all princes' and people's secular affairs
would thereby be defined, and elevated into an article
of faith.

The Austrian Government replied to the circular
that it would be inconsistent for nations accepting the
principles of religious liberty to offer a system of preventive
and restrictive measures against a movement
so deeply grounded in the constitution of the Church
as the assembling of a General Council. It was scarcely
to be supposed that Bishops of the Catholic world could
fail to take with them to Rome an accurate acquaintance
with the practical necessities of the age. Should

[Footnote 1: <i>Memoirs</i>, i. p. 326.]
-----File: p208.png--------------------------------------------------------
the approaching Council invade the province of political
affairs, it will then be time for the Governments to take
such measures as the case may need. This chilling
response made Prince Hohenlohe extremely indignant.
He declared that he had never proposed preventive
or restrictive measures, but asked what attitude the
Governments proposed to adopt toward the Council.
To delay until a decree was passed would leave the
Government no power except to protest.

/#
"We believe," he wrote,[1] "that we are not mistaken
when we maintain that not one of the Austrian Bishops
will attempt to oppose the proclamation of the dogma
of Infallibility. In this dogma lies the future of
Ultramontanism; in it lies the kernel of the absolutist
organisation of the hierarchy. It is the crowning of
the work for which the Ultramontane party has been
striving for years; and no Bishop will dare to move a
step in opposition to this aim. The hierarchy will
come out of the Council stronger and more powerful,
and begin the battle against modern civilization with
renewed strength."
#/

Unsupported, however, by the Austrian and other
Governments, the Bavarian could, of course, do nothing.

/#
"The Bavarian Government," wrote Hohenlohe,[2] "has
thereby, indeed, forfeited the sympathy of the Society
of Jesus, if indeed it ever had it; but it has won the
approval of all good Catholics who are not under the
influence of that Society."
#/

Bismarck declared that the movement in Bavaria had
resulted in increasing caution and conciliatoriness in
Rome. Prince Hohenlohe was in intimate contact with
Rome and its affairs through his brother the Cardinal,
who fully concurred with his antipathy to things

[Footnote 1: <i>Memoirs</i>, p. 338.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 356.]
-----File: p209.png--------------------------------------------------------
Ultramontane. Most instructive are the confidential
utterances of the Cardinal to the statesman, lamenting
the dominant influences on the eve of the Vatican
Council.

/#
"Perhaps the Holy Father is still deliberating," writes
the Cardinal in September 1869, about two months
before the Council opened, "but I doubt it. With all
my respect for the Supreme Head of the Church, my
obedience will be put to a severe test. I trust that God
will help me. I often ask myself, What shall I do in
these storms?"
#/

He feels himself isolated, and deliberately ignored
by the ruling authorities. He writes that Döllinger
could come to live with him in Rome. He will receive
into his own house any trustworthy theologian to
assist him while the Council proceeds. The Jesuits,
he says, have raised the question of Infallibility as a
standard.

/#
"The Pope is charmed with the idea, without the
least notion what the Jesuit party is saying and
doing. Touched by their devotion, he in his blindness
embraces the whole Order as the saviour of his honour
in the (quite unnecessarily raised) question of his
Infallibility.... The Infallibility question has thrown
Pius IX. so completely into the arms of the Jesuits, that
of all his plans and ideas against them not a trace
remains. The good fathers know that they can keep
a firm hold on Pius IX. only if he is driven into a
corner and <i>must</i> fly to them for help."
#/

It was arranged that Friedrich should go to Rome as
Cardinal Hohenlohe's theologian; but that he was to
live at the Cardinal's was to be kept profoundly secret.
"He should give some other reason, such as that he
wants to see Rome, or the like. You will understand
that better than I can tell you," says the Cardinal to
-----File: p210.png--------------------------------------------------------
his statesman-brother.[1] Meanwhile Prince Hohenlohe
was with Döllinger in Munich. He was there when
Döllinger received an autograph letter from the King
of Bavaria, praising his pamphlet against Infallibility.
The Cardinal wrote again from Rome[2] to say:--

/#
"There will be many a sharp tussle, and I fear the
Ultramontane party will have the majority. They are
impudent and reckless, and though at the present
moment the Pope is somewhat out of humour, owing
to various manifestations, such as Dupanloup, etc., yet
I think that at the crucial moment the impudent party
will endeavour to outshout all the others."[3]
#/

But the helplessness of the opposition is curiously
illustrated in the same letter. Cardinal Schwarzenberg,
a strong advocate of the minority, wanted greatly to
get Döllinger to Rome; yet he could not decide to send
for him as his theologian. Cardinal Hohenlohe wanted
greatly to receive the German Bishops at his house
every week, yet he could not make up his mind to do
it. He is afraid the Pope would forbid them to assemble
at his house. By February 1870 difficulties increased
vastly. "The situation," wrote Döllinger to Hohenlohe
"becomes more grave and threatening." It was just
announced that the Archbishop of Munich intended to
go over to the Infallibilists. Friedrich was by this time
lodged with Cardinal Hohenlohe in Rome, who was
"managing to keep him in spite of all enemies."[4]
"Stupidity and fanaticism," wrote the Cardinal,
"are dancing a Tarantella together, accompanied by
such discordant music that one can hardly see or
hear."

Friedrich is, of course, a violent partisan, and no

[Footnote 3: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 375]

[Footnote 4: <i>Ibid.</i> ii. 3.[**P2: in this order?  Not in book]]
-----File: p211.png--------------------------------------------------------
more capable of historical impartiality than Veuillot or
Manning. At the same time much may be ascertained
from each. Friedrich kept a diary through the critical
months of the sessions in Rome, which he afterwards
published. He had access to numerous distinguished
personages. He exerted, in his characteristically
German and professorial manner, no inconsiderable
influence on the theology of his master. He met
everybody in the Cardinal's rooms. Accustomed to
the freedom of a German University, with unlimited
access to literature of every kind, Friedrich finds himself
in a city under mediæval restrictions. Modern
theology of an anti-Infallibilist type could scarcely be
obtained at all in Rome, nor could it be smuggled
into the city through the post, nor printed in Rome,
nor could it be found in the libraries to which Friedrich
had access. Letters were opened in the post, or
permanently detained, as the authorities chose. The
police were ecclesiastical officials acting in the interests
of the Ultramontanes. Dressel, a learned German,
editor of an edition of the <i>Apostolic Fathers</i>, was
visited in Rome by a police officer, and informed that
he must leave the city for having written letters to
the <i>Augsburg Gazette</i>, in collaboration with Professor
Friedrich. Dressel protested that he had done nothing
of the kind. The only answer was that such were his
orders from the Vatican. Dressel appealed to Cardinal
Hohenlohe; also, and more effectively, to the Prussian
Ambassador, who made such emphatic moves that the
papal police did not venture on any further steps
against him.

Veuillot, who was then in Rome, got the following
criticisms on Cardinal Hohenlohe and Professor
Friedrich published in his journal, <i>L'Univers</i>, which he
edited in France.
-----File: p212.png--------------------------------------------------------

/#
"The Governor of the Eternal City, who is also head
of the police has at length discovered the source of the
indiscretions by which the secrets of the Council have
been betrayed. Suspicion had long rested on Abbé
Friedrich, whom Cardinal Hohenlohe brought from
Bavaria as his theologian during the Council. The
Abbé, in spite of protection from the Bavarian Legation,
has been compelled to leave Rome, Cardinal Hohenlohe
himself being anxious to dismiss an ecclesiastic who had
betrayed his confidence. It was reported in Rome that
the instigator of these deplorable disloyalties was Prince
Hohenlohe, President of the Bavarian Government."
#/

Meanwhile Friedrich, neither expelled nor dismissed,
was quietly residing in Rome and copying this extract
into his diary, with the thoughtful reflection: "I
wonder what part I am destined to play in an Ultramontane
history of the Vatican Council." Thus
Friedrich heard and saw many things. He heard
Bishop Hefele, on a visit to Cardinal Hohenlohe, say
that for thirty years he had sought for evidence on
Infallibility, and had never found it. To the same
house Hefele returned another day with a copy of
his pamphlet against Honorius. The chief value of
the work to Friedrich's mind consisted in the fact that,
as Bishop, Hefele did not repudiate German theology.

Friedrich's own line of action if the doctrine became
decreed was perfectly clear. He had no intention of
bowing before the storm, or of yielding an external
acquiescence to that which he inwardly discredited. A
criticism which appeared in the <i>Univers</i> indicated, in
the plainest terms, the future alternatives awaiting
the adherents of <i>Janus</i>, and indeed the opposition in
general.

/#
"Are they decided," asked Veuillot, "to remain
Catholics after the Definition? If they say no, their
#/
-----File: p213.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
Catholicity is already condemned. If yes, they are preparing
for themselves an act of faith and obedience
scarcely reasonable. For they now affirm that the
doctrine is contrary to the facts of history. Will they
believe that black is white because the Council says so,
investing it with a power to convert the false into true?"
#/

Friedrich agreed with Veuillot to this extent, that
history cannot be reversed by a conciliar decision. But
Friedrich did not attempt to conceal his conviction that
the Vatican Council was not Ecumenical. The regulations
imposed upon it, from without, by the papal power,
infringed its freedom of action, and kept it at the mercy
of the majority. To his mind there was little interest
or importance in the speeches delivered in the Council,
since the initiative and the moving power lay elsewhere.
He wrote dissertations, for the Cardinal Hohenlohe's
instruction, contrasting the principles of the earlier
Councils with the modern regulations. He affirmed that,
according to ancient precedent, the right of introducing
subjects lay with the Council itself, and not with the
Papal See; that the Council and not the Pope possessed
the power to define. But he saw that his own career
as Professor of Theology was at an end, if the Ultramontanes
should succeed. To continue in his former
capacity would be in that case to incur the reproach:
"You are a cowardly hypocrite, a liar; for you speak
against what you know to be the witness of scientific
history."

We owe to Friedrich the following letter, in which an
Oriental Bishop who had ventured to sign a protest in
Rome against the Infallibilist theory, makes an abject
recantation:--

/#
"Most Holy Father,[1] I entreat you to listen with
condescension and benevolence to the humblest of your

-----File: p214.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
beloved sons and the humblest of Bishops, who ventures,
prostrate before your feet, to address a few words to
your Holiness. I confess that I signed my name to the
Appeal which was presented to you, most clement
Father, by certain Oriental Bishops, entreating you with
all humility and reverence not to yield to a request
signed by the majority of Bishops that the Vatican
Council should be directed to define the Infallibility of
the Roman Pontiff. I signed my name to the Appeal,
chiefly on the ground of the difficulties which such a
decree of such a kind might create among schismatics
if misunderstood and misinterpreted; also on the
ground of the difficulty in reconciling with such a
definition the facts about Pope Honorius. But I had
no other ground of objection than these. I was not
actuated by any other human or less honourable motive;
nor by party spirit; nor, as certain ill-disposed persons
have maliciously insinuated, and which God forbid, by any
hostile or disrespectful sentiment either toward yourself,
most Holy Father, or towards the Apostolic Roman
See, which is the fortress of truth and of religion, the
immortal centre of our glory. Nevertheless, considering
that certain newspapers have most unreasonably
inferred from this Appeal that the Orientals were hostile
towards the Roman Pontiff and the Holy See; considering
also that other newspapers have made it an
opportunity for advancing and strengthening the so-called
Gallican views, identifying us with them, whereas
we have never really had anything in common; whereas,
both as teacher in theology and as Bishop, I have
always held and taught the belief that the judgment of
the Sovereign Pontiff, speaking <i>ex cathedra</i> as universal
doctor by the institution of Jesus Christ, and as head of
the Immaculate Church, must be actually irreformable;
having accordingly studied the subject more
deeply and the consequences involved; having also
made myself familiar with the replies to the exaggerated
and blamable tracts of the priest Gratry, particularly
the excellent and solid refutation recently composed
by Father Ramière of the Society of Jesus; finally having
#/
-----File: p215.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
had the good fortune to meet with a very ancient
manuscript of a history composed by a Nestorian, containing
a convincing exculpation of Pope Honorius from
all error in faith: for these reasons and for other conscientious
motives, I feel myself constrained to affirm,
most Holy Father, not only that belief in the inerrancy
of the Sovereign Pontiff when deciding <i>ex cathedra</i> in
matters of faith and morals, is mine, and that I have
always held it, but also that under the circumstances it
appears to me reasonable, by no means dangerous--on
the contrary, very advisable--that the Universal Council
should dogmatically determine that the Infallibility or
supreme authority exercised by the Sovereign Pontiff
as universal doctor of the Church is of the institution
of Christ, is founded in Holy Scripture and in Tradition,
consequently that it is of faith. I declare it
in the simplicity of my heart. This is demanded by
truth and theological thought. This is demanded by
the pure doctrine of the Roman Church. This by great
good fortune I inbibed[**P2: imbibed?] in my youth in its purest source,
the Roman College of the Propaganda itself. This I
have defended. It is demanded by the opposition of
men of malignant intentions against the Holy See. It
is demanded by the intolerable violence of the enemies
of our religion and of the Holy Roman See. It is
demanded by our love and our reverence for the
Sovereign Pontiff and the Holy See. It is demanded by
our honour. Finally it is demanded by the authority
of many doctors, and, in the words of St Augustine, by
the entire Catholic Church."

Friedrich continued to reside in Rome till the 13th of
May. Some time before this he felt that his work was
done. He was anxious to leave. "I neither will nor
can be any longer," he wrote, "a witness in this place
to the oppression of the Church."

[Footnote 1: Friedrich, <i>Tagebuch</i>, p. 319.]

In a farewell visit to the Archbishop of Munich, Scherr
congratulated Friedrich on his ability to return home,
and expressed a wish that he could do the same. The
Archbishop took the opportunity of sending a message
to Döllinger, advising him to restrain his energies. The
Bishops had done and were doing their duty. Scherr
strongly impressed upon Friedrich the necessity of
making his influence felt with Cardinal Hohenlohe. If
only a Cardinal resident in Rome itself had but the
courage to utter an emphatic <i>non placet</i> in the Council,
the Bishops would be greatly strengthened to follow suit.
Friedrich disowned the possession of any such influence
as the Archbishop ascribed to him, but promised
to report to the Cardinal the Archbishop's desires.
Friedrich left Rome with a strong foreboding that
personal Infallibility would certainly be defined.

CHAPTER XV

THE IMMEDIATE PREPARATIONS


When Pius IX. had finally resolved on assembling a
Council he proceeded without delay to the necessary
preparations. These preparations may be classified as
twofold: those within the Roman Communion, and
those relating to other religious bodies.

1. The internal preparations were largely entrusted to
a Commission of Cardinals, selected for that purpose.
The Cardinals reported to the Pope upon the following
points.

First came the important problem, to determine who
were qualified for membership in a Council of the
Church. The Episcopate, of course, without all doubt.
But did this apply only to Bishops possessing diocesan
jurisdiction, or did it include those who possessed no
definite See? It was urged that the latter were just
as really Bishops as the former, and that their omission
might raise disputes on the Council's validity. It was
accordingly decided that, with the Pope's approval,
titular Bishops as well as diocesan were qualified for
seats in the coming Assembly.

The case of Abbots and generals of religious Orders
was considered next. If these did not possess episcopal
authority, they possessed at least a real, a semi-episcopal
jurisdiction; being themselves superiors over a considerable
multitude, and also exempt from episcopal control.
-----File: p218.png--------------------------------------------------------
This quasi-episcopal position was considered by the
Congregation to qualify them for admission to the
Vatican Council. These decisions were of great significance,
as they added, it is said, almost two hundred
votes.[1]

Secondly, as to regulations for procedure,[2] the
Cardinals asserted that the Pope alone had the right
to introduce matters for discussion. Otherwise, argued
the Cardinals, the Council would become a constitutional
chamber. But a Council is only summoned to
discuss what the Pope desires to have discussed; not to
introduce their individual conceptions of what ought to
be done. If any reminiscences of the principles of
Constance, Pisa, and Basle floated before the Cardinals'
memories; if any distant echo of their predecessors'
intention to reform the Church in its head and members
haunted them; it was instantly condemned by the
theory now introduced. By way of dispelling the
possible objection that the Pope might omit important
matters, the Cardinals observed that it is an unlikely
thing, that it must be left to Providence, and that you
cannot expect perfection in human affairs. Whatever,
therefore, the Bishops desire to introduce for conciliar
discussion, they must report it, not to the Council, but to
the Pope or to his representative; and the Pope will
determine whether its introduction is desirable or not.
The Cardinals recommend that a Commission should
be created for this purpose.

In the third place, it was thought desirable that four
permanent Commissions should be formed: one on
faith; one on discipline; one on religious orders;
one on missions. It was suggested that two-thirds
of the members should be chosen by the Bishops
and one-third by the Pope. Pius, however, decided

[Footnote 1: Friedrich, <i>Döllinger</i>, iii. p. 206ff.]

[Footnote 2: Cecconi, i. p. 165.]
-----File: p219.png--------------------------------------------------------
that the selection should be entirely left to the
Bishops.

Another question creating no inconsiderable discussion
was whether the Bishops should be required to
pronounce a profession of faith. The problem was
whether the dogma of the Immaculate Conception
should be included. It was contained in no existing
formula of faith. Some were adverse to its introduction.
Others thought it impossible for the Council to ignore
the existence of this dogma. Some again held that
since the dogma had already been declared by the
Pope, there could be no necessity to insert it in a
Council's decree. For this reason it ought to be
recited in the profession of faith. Nevertheless it was
held wiser not to introduce it, for fear of producing
upon the Bishops a bad impression. Accordingly it
was decided to fall back on the Creed of the Council
of Trent.

In the Commission a discussion was also held on
the burning question of pontifical Infallibility. Two
questions were raised: Was it definable? was it
opportune? The former was answered in the affirmative.
So was the latter, but with the proviso that it
ought not to be proposed by the Holy See, except at
the request of the Bishops. Accordingly no further
mention was made of the subject in the Cardinal's
report. Nevertheless they did not cease to study it.

2. The external preparation for the Council, beyond
the limits of the Roman body, consisted in a series of
letters and announcements to the other Churches of
Christendom.

Three Papal letters were issued in reference to the
Council's actual assembling.[1]

[Footnote 1: Cecconi, i. p. 379.]
-----File: p220.png--------------------------------------------------------

First the Bull summoning the Bishops of the Roman
Communion [29th June 1869], together with the Abbots,
and all persons qualified either by right or privilege;
requiring them, and exhorting them by their fidelity
to the Roman See, and under the penalties appointed
for disobedience, to attend at the Vatican on 8th
December.

Was it accident or design which twice over introduced
into this letter the famous phrase <i>majorem Dei gloriam</i>?
Certainly it was not accident which omitted from the
enumeration of the Council's uses and purposes all
reference to the problem of pontifical Infallibility, and
rested content with a general allusion to the wise
ordering of those things which pertain to defining
dogmas of faith.

A second letter[1] was directed to the Bishops of the
Oriental rite not in communion with the Apostolic See.
In this letter a solicitude is expressed for all Christians
everywhere; more especially for those Churches which
were formerly united with the Apostolic See, but now
by the machinations of the Author of all schisms are
unhappily parted. The Oriental Bishops are entreated
to come to this General Synod, as their fathers came
to that of Florence--in order to be reunited to the
Apostolic See, which is the centre of Catholic truth
and unity.

Another letter[2] was directed to all Protestants and
other non-Catholics. They are aware that Pius has
thought it desirable to summon all Catholic Bishops
to a Council at Rome. He is confident that this will
issue to the greater glory of God. He calls upon them
to reconsider whether they are following the way presented
by Christ. No community can form a part

[Footnote 1: Cecconi, i. p. 387 (8th September 1868).]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 390 (13th September 1868).]
-----File: p221.png--------------------------------------------------------
of the Catholic Church if visibly severed from Catholic
unity. Such communities are destitute of that Divinely
constituted authority which insures against variation
and instability. Accordingly he exhorts and beseeches
them to return to the one fold of Christ.

The replies of the Oriental Churches claim independence
and equality. The Greek Patriarch at
Constantinople declared that the Oriental Church
would never consent to abandon the doctrine which
it held from the Apostles, transmitted by the Holy
Fathers, and the eight Ecumenical Councils. The
Ecumenical Council is the supreme tribunal to which
all Bishops, Patriarchs, and Popes are subjected.

The Armenian Patriarch criticised the Pope's action
with severity; asserted that the principles of equality
and apostolic brotherhood had not been observed by
the Pope. The rank which the Canons ascribe to the
Papal See only give him the right to address personal
letters to the Bishops and Synods of the East, but
not to impose upon them his will by encyclicals in
the tone of a master. The Armenian Patriarch wrote
to the Catholicos of Ecmiazin to say that "the
Patriarch of the Roman Church--Pius IX." had sent
a letter, announcing a Council. The Catholicos replied
that the tone of the Pope's letter gave no hope that
union would be realised: for it did not acknowledge
the chief Pastors of the Eastern Church as equals in
honour and dignity. And yet they are successors of
the Apostles. They have received the same authority
from the Holy Spirit as the Roman Patriarch.

The attitude of the German Protestants was uncompromising.
The Nuncio in Bavaria wrote to
Antonelli that the Germans regarded the invitation as
an insult. There might be individual conversions, but
certainly not a general return. The common opinion was:
-----File: p222.png--------------------------------------------------------
the Pope invites us graciously to put ourselves at the
mercy of the Council; but the bird which has escaped
rejoices in its liberty. There existed a vague, indeterminate
desire for unity, but entire diversity as to the
basis for its realisation; and the personal interest of
the Pastors was against unity.

From Berlin came this criticism on the Pope's letter:
"We hold it impossible to find in this letter the least
indication of really conciliatory spirit on the basis of
evangelical truth." The Protestants assembled at Worms
declared that the principal cause of the divisions which
they deplored was the spirit and action of the Jesuit
Society. This Society which, according to their view,
was the deadly foe of Protestantism, stifled all freedom
of thought, and dominated the entire existing Roman
Church. If the permanent union and well-being of
Christendom was to be secured, hierarchical pretensions
must be laid aside. Elsewhere the resolution was passed
to ignore the Pope's invitation, as being merely a matter
of form.

An American Presbyterian reply to the Pope's
letter said, that while firmly convinced that the unity
of the Church is the will of Christ, they felt it a duty
to state the reasons why they cannot unite in the
deliberations of the coming Council. It is not that
they reject a single article of the Catholic Religion.
They are no heretics. They accept the Apostles' Creed
and the doctrinal decisions of the first six General
Councils. But they cannot assent to the doctrines of
the Council of Trent. The barrier which this Council
has erected between them and Rome is insurmountable.

Certainly nothing was further from the Pope's intentions
than to invite members or representatives of any
other Communion to discussion. All he intended was
to advise them to profit by this occasion, to submit
-----File: p223.png--------------------------------------------------------
and secure their eternal salvation. If, said Pius, they
would only seek with all their hearts, they would
easily lay aside their preconceived opinions, and return
to their Father from whom they have so unhappily
departed. He would receive them with paternal
benevolence. And then, with a scarcely diplomatic
allusion to the prodigal who had wasted his substance
in riotous living, Pius declared he would rejoice to say,
"These my sons were dead and are alive again; they
were lost, and are found."[1]

In the English Church opinion was divided as to the
manner and spirit in which the Pope's letter should be
met. Bishop Wordsworth of Lincoln[2] replied in a
Latin letter. He assumed that the English Church was
included in the letter addressed to all Protestants;
and accepted the title in the sense of protesting
against errors contrary to the Catholic Faith. He
resented the tone and temper of the Pope's appeal;
the judgment implied on the validity of the English
Episcopate; protested that we have never seceded
from the Catholic Church, nor separated willingly even
from the Church of Rome; criticised in particular the
doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, as an instance
of indisputable variation; and added certain unhappy
exegetical remarks of an apocalyptic character on the
relation between Rome and Babylon. This line of
response probably represented no inconsiderable element
at the period at which it was written.

On the other hand, a section existed in the English
Church, keenly alive to its local deficiencies, and
possessed with strong and enthusiastic aspirations for
corporate reunion. In their opinion, faults of taste
and assumptions due to Italian ignorance or other

[Footnote 1: Cecconi, ii. p. 304.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Miscellanies Lit. and Religious</i>, i. p. 330, in Latin; transl. p. 344.]
-----File: p224.png--------------------------------------------------------
points of view, might well be overlooked, if not condoned,
in the interests of what appeared to be a
genuine desire for unity. A resentful and criticising
spirit seemed only calculated to frustrate all hope of
better things. The magnificence of the coming
Assembly, the grandeur of its scale, the regions it
involved, the Churches it included, captivated their
imaginations. Whatever might be the individual view
of the relative position of the separated portions of the
great Christian family, such a gathering as this must
enlist their respect, their sympathy, and their prayers.
They pleaded earnestly for corporate reunion. As the
separation was corporate, so must the reconciliation be.
They insisted as strenuously as any other members of
the Anglican Communion on the impossibility under
present circumstances of doing anything else than
remain where they are.[1]

/#
"You require us, for instance, to say--not formally
indeed, but in effect--that we have no priest and no
sacraments; whilst it is quite plain to us that our present
Episcopate is in all respects the true and lineal
descendant of the Apostolic Mission in this land.
You require us to renounce communion with the
Church of England on the ground that she is heretical;
we, on the other hand, are convinced that there is
nothing in her <i>authorised</i> teaching which you do not
yourselves teach in your own pulpits and Catechisms.
That she is actually separated from the centre of
visible Catholic unity is a fact deplorable indeed, but
too patent to be questioned; that she is wilfully [**P2: willfully],
avowedly, and therefore guiltily schismatical we utterly
deny; to say that we ourselves are schismatics is
simply to give the lie to the most cherished longing
of our hearts. No! we <i>must</i> remain where God has
placed us, loyal to our own Communion and to our

[Footnote 1: G. F. Cobb, <i>Few Words on Reunion</i> (1869), p. 6.]
-----File: p225.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
own Episcopate, loyal at the same time (in spirit) to
yours: if we are not of the <i>body</i> of your Church, we
belong at any rate to its <i>soul</i>."
#/

After this vigorous declaration of principles and
loyalty the reunionist felt justified in confessing the
defects within the Anglican Communion of which he
was painfully conscious.

/#
"Need we, after all, be so very angry at being classed
with Protestants--if it be true that we have been so--when
at least half our brother Churchmen rejoice at it,
and are never tired of proclaiming to the world that we
are a Protestant Church, a creation of the sixteenth
century, specially commissioned to wage war with the
Papal anti-Christ to the end of time? Even regarding
our Communion from the most favourable point of view,
can we say that she has done very much during the
centuries of her separation from the Holy See towards
vindicating her Catholicity even in the Anglican sense
of the word? Does she present herself to her Catholic
brethren on the Continent in any very marked contrast
to the Protestant sects?"
#/

Thus there was at least in certain directions within the
Anglican Communion a distinct readiness to respond
to any overtures for unity. There was in addition a
very wide-spread interest in the coming Council, not
unmixed with curiosity and anxiety as to the steps
which might be taken to bring the severed sections of
Christendom nearer together.

By far the most penetrating and profound on the
Anglican side was Dr Pusey. Perfectly clear and
sure of his position, whole-hearted in his devotion to
his own Communion, he insisted that the English
Church must be treated collectively: as a portion of
the Church Catholic, to be reunited; not as individuals,
-----File: p226.png--------------------------------------------------------
to be absorbed. He was in correspondence with the
Bishop of Orleans and the Archbishop of Paris. With
this aim he wrote his Eirenicon, Is Healthful Reunion
Impossible? The Belgian Jesuit De Buck corresponded
with Bishop Forbes of Brechin. The Jesuit Father

/#
"was certain that at Rome there was no wish for
Infallibility." He "maintained that every one at Rome
was astonished to hear that the Anglican Bishops did
not consider the command to attend the Council as
addressed to them."[1]
#/

Attempts were made by Newman to induce Pusey
to visit Rome; or at least to get up a big petition
and present it to the Holy See;[2] quietly observing at
the same time that the sort of petition which he had
in view "cuts off the subscribers to it from the existing
Establishment;"[3] Newman also suggested that
no Anglican Bishops should go. Pusey replied by
enquiring why should not Newman himself go to
Rome for the Council. Dupanloup invited him as
his theologian. But Newman declined, on the pretext
that he was not a theologian, and would only be
wasting his time in matters which he did not understand.[4]

Not unnaturally, Pusey's penetrating criticism was:--

/#
"If they invited any, it should be Bishops. Theologians
go to accompany their Bishops. They have
ignored our Bishops, and ask any of us whom they
may ask informally, because they will deliberately
withhold all acknowledgement of the slightest basis
upon which we can treat as a Church."[5]

"I have no doubt," Pusey added, "that the invitation
to Rome is given in the hope that the imposing spectacle
presented by the Council may bring about individual

/#
conversions of English Churchmen more or less learned
or well known. But what can we expect when they
invited the great Greek Church simply to submit?
I expect nothing under the present Pope."[1]

"The difficulty of treating is this, that we have two
entirely distinct objects: we, corporate reunion upon
explanation of certain points where they have laid
down a <i>minimum</i> and upon a large range beyond
it; they, individual conversions or the absorption
of us."
#/

Meanwhile, Pusey prepared an edition of Cardinal
Torquemada's great work, against the doctrine of the
Immaculate Conception, originally composed for use
at the Council of Basle at the instigation of Pope
Paul III. This edition Pusey dedicated to the Council
about to be held in Rome. He sent copies to Rome
for the Bishop of Orleans, and other members of the
Council. These were returned from Rome with <i>refusé</i>
written upon them.[2] Pusey wrote to Newman to
enquire what this meant. Newman answered that he
was certain that the Bishop to whom the books were sent
would not be guilty of such incivility; and suggested
a suspicion that the Roman police would not pass a
book with Pusey's name. This suspicion proved correct.
Newman wrote again: "I had a very kind letter from
Bishop Clifford, telling me that neither he nor the Bishop
of Orleans had refused my book, and asking me to send
it to him at Clifton."[3] But these despotic methods of
government at the end of the nineteenth century were
hardly conducive to the advancement of mutual understanding,
or indeed to the interests of truth. The
movements at Rome were watched by Pusey with
ever-deepening sorrow:--

"Manning's is a strange lot," he wrote "with,

-----File: p228.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
I should have thought, but a very moderate share
of learning, by throwing himself into the tide, to
seem to be at the head of a movement which should
revolutionise the Church. It is a mysterious lot, one
which one would not like for oneself. The composition
of the Congregation on Dogma has discouraged us.
Those whom we should have had most confidence in,
Mgrs. Dupanloup and Darboy, omitted, and Manning
in it. It is utterly hopeless to send any propositions
to a Congregation in which Manning should be a
leading member. I am told that he has been impressing
the Council, or at least important Bishops, with
the idea that hundreds of thousands of the English
would join the Roman Communion if the Infallibility
were declared."[1]
#/

Pusey's biographers say that

/#
"as the meetings of the Council went on, Pusey had
really very little hope of any wise result."[2]

"In all later issues of his third Eirenicon, Pusey
altered the title from 'Is Healthful Reunion Possible?'
to a form which embodied his future attitude towards
the Roman question--'Healthful Reunion, as conceived
possible before the Vatican Council.'"[3]

CHAPTER XVI

THE OPENING OF THE VATICAN COUNCIL


The Council of the Vatican was opened on the Feast
of the Immaculate Conception (8th December 1869).[1]
There was significance in the selection of the day.
That very day, fifteen years before, Pius IX. had
proclaimed a new dogma on the Virgin; and, as a
fervid prelate assured him, he who had declared the
Virgin immaculate was now to be proclaimed by her
infallible. The Council was held in the South Transept
of St Peter's, and at the opening service seven hundred
and two members were present.[2] So large an Assembly
had never been held before. The proportions of the
two opinions were roughly between four and five
hundred Infallibilists and between one and two hundred
opponents of the doctrine.

Meetings of the Council were of two kinds: the
ordinary Congregations, at which none but members
and officials were permitted to be present, while the
proceedings were secret; the Public Sessions, at which
the public were admitted, and the Decrees proclaimed.
Of the former kind there were in all eighty-nine,
of the latter four. Only two, however, of the Public
Sessions declared matters decreed: for the first was
entirely occupied with ceremonial, and at the second

[Footnote 1: <i>Acta.</i>]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i>]
-----File: p230.png--------------------------------------------------------
(6th January) no Decrees were ready; it was accordingly
devoted to recitals of the Creed of the Council of
Trent. The Pope was never present except at the four
Public Sessions. He exerted his influence without compromising
his dignity.

The secrecy of the proceedings was thoroughly in
accordance with the Italian disposition. Every official
and member of the Council was sworn to observe it.
But the regulation proved ineffective, partly because
the Pope himself released certain members of the
majority from the necessity of its observance, and
partly because the incessant discussions in unofficial
assemblies of the Bishops could not easily escape
publicity. Much information leaked out in various
directions and appeared in print.

The influence of Pius IX. upon the Council was
exercised partly through official documents. Three
important papers[1] were issued by him to the Council
during its early period: The Constitution on Procedure
(18th December 1869); on Election to the Papacy in
case of a Vacancy (1st January 1870); on Absolving
from Ecclesiastical Censures (15th January 1870). The
significance of the last may be measured by the following
description. Its effect was "to cancel episcopal
encroachments on the Papal authority."[2] The second
was intended to prevent any assertion of power by
the Council in case the Pope might die.

But far the most important of these three Constitutions
was that which regulated the Council's procedure
(<i>multiplices inter</i>). This remarkable document asserted
that the right of proposing subjects for discussion
belonged to the Papal See, but that the Pope nevertheless
desired and exhorted the Bishops to give in
their proposals to a Congregation appointed for that

[Footnote 1: <i>Acta.</i>]

[Footnote 2: Ollivier, i. p. 460.]
-----File: p231.png--------------------------------------------------------
purpose. The value of the concession was qualified
by the fact that the Congregation in question was
selected entirely by the Pope, and was composed of
Ultramontanes.

All the officers of the Council, including the five
Presidents, were appointed by the Pope on his own
authority; and their names were given in this Decree.
The details of procedure were also therein defined. No
Bishop was to leave without the Pope's permission.

This certainly was a striking document. The French
statesman, Ollivier, says that "its novelty, its boldness,
its audacity is only realised when compared with the
proceedings at Trent."[1] At Trent the Regulations were
determined by the Bishops themselves.

When the Vatican Council began its work, several
Bishops, including the Archbishop of Paris, attempted
to protest against the restrictions imposed upon them;
but the presiding Cardinal suppressed all objections
with a declaration that the Pope had so ordained, and
that his decisions could not be called in question. To
this declaration the minority submitted. Thereby in
effect they acknowledged the Pope's power to determine
the Regulations. This has been called "the first of the
feeblenesses, or to speak more indulgently, the resignations
of the minority."[2]

The actual product of the Vatican Council consists
of two Dogmatic Constitutions known respectively by
their opening words as the Constitution Dei Filius
and the Constitution Pastor Æternus. Of these the
former was proclaimed in the third Public Session,
the latter in the fourth Public Session. The contents
of the former are the doctrine of God, of Revelation,
of Faith, and of the relation between Faith and
Reason. The latter contains the Ultramontane theory

[Footnote 1: Ollivier, i. p. 466.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> ii. pp. 21-23.]
-----File: p232.png--------------------------------------------------------
of the Papacy, and especially the dogma of the Pope's
Infallibility. It is with this last subject exclusively
that we are concerned.

This subject of Papal Infallibility was not mentioned
among the causes for which the Council was assembled,
nor was it introduced into the discussion for the first
three months. During that period the Bishops' attention
was devoted to discussions on faith; the discipline
of the clergy; the project of the compilation
of a new Catechism, for universal use, in place of all
local Catechisms in the Roman body. Matters such
as these occupied the first twenty-eight Congregations.
But progress was excessively slow: partly owing to
the reluctance of the minority to proceed, under fear
of what the future would produce, and under dislike of
various extreme measures proposed to them. It seems
clear that the Roman authorities had not anticipated
so much persistent opposition. At the end of three
months, minority-Bishops said with relief, "We have
done nothing, and that is a great deal." The Dogmatic
Constitution on faith was expected to be ready for
the second Public Session on 6th January. But when
the date arrived the doctrine was not ready. Consequently
the entire Session was occupied by formal
recitation of the Tridentine Creed.

In January 1870 the crisis became acute when
Manning and other members of the Vatican Council
presented the Pope with an Address, urging him to
declare his own Infallibility.

Upon this Döllinger wrote his "Few Words" to the
<i>Augsburg Gazette</i>. He pointed out with all possible
emphasis the magnitude of the suggested revolution.
He declared that Papal Infallibility had never been
believed hitherto--believed, that is, with the faith due
to a divine revelation. Between the faith due to a truth
-----File: p233.png--------------------------------------------------------
divinely revealed through the Church, and the acceptance
of a theological theory, the difference is immense.
Hitherto there had been conjectures, opinions, probabilities,
even human certainty in individual minds
as to Papal Infallibility; but never that divine faith
which is the response of the Catholic to the doctrine
of the Church. Döllinger added that while the
Infallibilists' Address spoke of the Pope being infallible
when instructing the entire Church, it was historically
clear that all papal utterances on doctrine during the
first twelve hundred years were directed to individuals
or local communities.

The effect of this urgent appeal to historic certainties
was very considerable. Archbishop Scherr, Döllinger's
diocesan, had a very uneasy time in consequence at
the hands of the Jesuits and the majority in Rome.
Although his personal conviction and sympathy were
with the learned historian, he could not help a certain
human self-pity, and he is said to have sighed, "What
a comfort it would be if only Döllinger would expire!"
But the vigorous old Professor seemed in no way likely
to comply with the archiepiscopal wishes.

A further stage in Vatican procedure was reached
when Pius IX. imposed upon the Council, on 22nd
February 1870, a new series of Regulations which
were designed to accelerate progress, and to drive
things forward to their intended conclusion.

These <i>New Regulations</i> as to procedure were introduced
into the Council without its consultation or
consent. They were simply imposed upon the
Council, from without; by the same authority which
directed everything without personally appearing.
The main features of the New Regulations are two.
The first rule authorised the Presidents to control any
individual speaker who in their opinion wandered from
-----File: p234.png--------------------------------------------------------
the point. Another rule gave the Presidents power, at
the request of ten Fathers and with the approval of the
majority, to closure the discussion. This second Regulation
involved tremendous possibilities. It placed the
minority entirely at the mercy of the majority. It thereby
determined a principle more momentous still--namely,
that Decrees of Faith could be imposed on the Church
by mere majority of votes. Hitherto the minority had
taken refuge in the principle that no opinion could
be elevated into a dogma of faith without the Council's
moral unanimity. The existence of an opposition so
extensive as between one hundred and two hundred
Bishops rendered the Church secure on that theory
from the imposition of the Ultramontane conception
of papal prerogatives. But the New Regulations swept
that plea of moral unanimity entirely away. Whatever
was the intention of its propounders, its effect is clear;
and that effect was disastrous to the men who clung
to what they regarded as the ancient truth. Naturally
the depression of the minority was profound.

Döllinger wrote a very powerful criticism upon these
New Regulations.[1] He characterised the existing Roman
Synod as the first in history in which instructions as to
procedure had been imposed upon the Bishops without
their co-operation or approval. The New Regulations
concentrated all real power in the hands of the presiding
Cardinals and the Commission of Suggestions, so that
the Council itself, as opposed to these, had neither power
nor will. Equally momentous was the fact that doctrine
was to be determined by majorities. This was an
intrusion of parliamentary forms into synodical procedure--with
this tremendous difference: that whereas laws
passed by majorities are subject to subsequent revision
and recall, dogmatic resolutions are, if the Council be

[Footnote 1: Reusch, <i>Declarations and Decrees.</i>]
-----File: p235.png--------------------------------------------------------
really ecumenical, irrevocable and valid for all future
time. The Infallibilist majority would naturally accept
the dogmatic proposals introduced by the Commission
of Suggestions; for that Commission, which alone
possessed the privilege of introducing doctrine into the
Council, and of determining what amendments should
be admitted, and the form which those amendments
should take, consisted of the most pronounced advocates
of Infallibility. And this decision by majorities was
utterly alien to the traditional methods of Christendom.
"For eighteen hundred years," said Döllinger, "it has
been held as a principle of the Church that decrees
concerning faith and doctrine should be adopted by
at least moral unanimity." And this because Bishops
at a Council are primarily witnesses to the faith which
they and their Churches have received; secondly, judges
to examine whether the conditions of universality, perpetuity,
and consent are fulfilled by a given doctrine;
whether it is really a universal doctrine of the whole
Church, and a constituent portion of the original Deposit
divinely intrusted to the Church's keeping, and therefore
a doctrine which every Christian must affirm.
Consequently the judicial function of the episcopate
cannot exclude the past. It extends across all history.

/#
"A Council only makes dogmatic decrees on things
already universally believed in the Church, as being
testified by the Scriptures and by Tradition, or which
are contained, as evident and clear deductions, in the
principles which have been already believed and taught.
Should, for example, the Infallibility of a single
individual be put in the place of the freedom from
error of the whole Church, as formerly believed and
taught, this would be no development nor explanation
of what was hitherto implicitly believed, nor is it a

the very opposite of the earlier doctrine, which thereby
would be subverted."

Döllinger contended further that all theologians agree
that the ecumenical character of a Council depends,
among other essential conditions, upon the possession
of real freedom. Real freedom does not consist in mere
immunity from physical force. Fear, ambition, avarice,
as effectually destroy true freedom as bodily constraint.
Moreover, urged Döllinger, even if a Council be
ecumenical in its vocation, it does not follow that it
is also ecumenical in its procedures or in its conclusions.
"It is still necessary that the authority which
stands ever above every Council--the testimony of the
whole Church--should come forward and decide."

This was Döllinger's final protest before the decision.[1]
A Bishop of the majority replied by prohibiting
theological students in his diocese from attending
Döllinger's lectures. Pius congratulated the Bishop on
this action, and wished that others would follow his
example; which however they declined to do. A war
of pamphlets followed. Döllinger was attacked in a
party newspaper as having by his recent writings
placed himself outside the Catholic Church. Hötzl,[2] a
Franciscan lecturer on theology, afterwards Bishop of
Augsberg, published a pamphlet entitled, "Is Döllinger
a Heretic?" This was too much for the King of
Bavaria. He expressed in a birthday letter the
earnest hope that Döllinger might long be spared in
undiminished mental and bodily powers to the service
of religion and of learning. Hötzl's imprudent act
awakened so many demonstrations of sympathy and
approval towards Döllinger that it was thought wise to
transfer Hötzl to Rome.

-----File: p237.png--------------------------------------------------------

It was impossible, of course, that these New Regulations,
involving for the minority such tremendous
possibilities, should be tamely acquiesced in without a
protest. The protest came, partly in the form of written
appeals to the Pope, and partly in speeches in the
Congregation. One of the ablest orators in the Council,
the brilliant Strossmayer, being called to order by the
President, uttered against the Rules the following
impassioned criticism:--

/#
"I am persuaded that the perpetual and unmistakable
rule of faith and tradition always was and always must
remain that nothing could be passed without morally
unanimous consent. A Council which ignored this rule,
and attempted to define dogmas of faith and morals by
a numerical majority, binding thereby the conscience of
the Catholic world under penalties of eternal life and
death, would, according to my most profound conviction,
have transgressed its lawful bounds."[1]
#/

As Strossmayer uttered the closing words the Council
Chamber was filled with the wildest tumult, says Lord
Acton, and the Session was broken up.[2]

Written protests were sent to the Pope against the
New Regulations by the minority, but no relief was
given. What were they now to do? They had complained,
on ground of conscience, that the freedom of the
Council was impaired. This complaint affected the
Council's validity. Could they reasonably continue
their work within it? On the other hand, no actual
Decree was threatened as yet. Was it wise to withdraw
before the repulsive doctrine was introduced? The
instincts of caution prevailed over bolder and more
resolute lines. The minority protested, but submitted.[3]

CHAPTER XVII

THE VATICAN DECISION


If the actual subject of Infallibility had not yet entered
the Council for discussion, it was anxiously or eagerly
debated in every mind. As far back as the beginning
of the year (28th January 1870), a petition[1] under the
instigation of Archbishop Manning was sent to the
Commission on Faith, entreating that the doctrine of
Infallibility might be brought before the Council. This
petition for a Decree on Papal Infallibility was based
upon the following grounds. It was, they said, opportune
and necessary, because, according to the universal and
constant tradition of the Church, papal decrees of
doctrine could not be reformed; because some who
gloried in the name of Catholic were presuming to
teach that deferential submission to papal authority
was sufficient; that one might acquiesce in silence
without inward mental consent, or might at any rate
accord a merely provisional assent until the Church
itself endorsed or modified the decree in question.
This independence was, they considered, injurious and
subversive of authority. Prevalent disputes made
definition a positive necessity. If the Vatican Council,
thus challenged, neglected to testify to Catholic Faith,
the Catholic world would fall into uncertainty, and the

[Footnote 1: <i>Acta</i>, p. 923.]
-----File: p239.png--------------------------------------------------------
heretical world would rejoice. Various local synods,
moreover, had already passed resolutions for Papal
Infallibility.

Petitions were also issued on the other side. Copies
of a circular had reached them requesting the definition
of Papal Infallibility. Accordingly they are constrained
to address the Pope. This is not a time in which the
rights of the Apostolic See are questioned by Catholics,
and it is undesirable to add to the doctrines of the Council
of Trent. The difficulties which the writings of the
Fathers, and the genuine documents and facts of history
suggest to many minds, on the subject of Infallibility,
preclude the definition of this doctrine as a truth divinely
revealed, until the difficulties have been removed. They
implore the Pope not to impose such discussions upon
them.[1]

This was in January. Nothing was immediately done.
But <i>on the 6th of March</i> a notice was sent to the
members individually, informing them that, in response
to the appeal of many Bishops, the Pope had consented
to the introduction of Papal Infallibility into the Council.
They were accordingly requested to send in their written
remarks within ten days.

Accordingly written criticisms were sent in to the
Commission on Faith. And it is to this fact that we
owe a large portion of our knowledge of the actual
argument employed by Infallibilists by the minority
in the Council. For their criticisms were condensed
and printed for distribution among the members, and
copies of this have survived the Council.[2] This is all
the more important since the proceedings of the Council
were nominally secret, and no official report of the
speeches was ever given to the world, and the actual
minutes are buried in the Vatican archives. A Jesuit

[Footnote 1: <i>Acta</i>, p. 944.]

[Footnote 2: Friedrich, <i>Documenta</i>.]
-----File: p240.png--------------------------------------------------------
German writer[1] on the Council has had access to these,
and has given extracts and accounts of them; but no
complete account has ever yet appeared. Meanwhile
great value must attach to the printed criticisms of
the doctrine. These, as was natural, are chiefly the
work of the opposition. Some one hundred and thirty-nine
Bishops replied, of whom nearly one hundred were
against the decree. Its advocates contented themselves
with general expressions of approval. The opposition
to the proposed definition was begun by the criticisms
of Cardinal Rauscher.

Rauscher said that the question was not whether the
instructions of the Pope should be obeyed, but whether
they must be received with the faith due to God. The
salvation of souls and the honour of the Council demand
that the greatest caution should be exercised before
imposing this upon the faith of Christian people. He
confessed himself, although prepared to defend what the
Council might decree, unable to solve the difficulties
which would arise. To those already persuaded conviction
would not be difficult. But Bishops in Austria and
Germany would have a difficult time. "The subterfuges
employed by not a few theologians in the case of
Honorius would only expose the writers to derision."
To propound such sophistries appears to him unworthy
alike of the episcopal office and of the subject in
question, which ought to be treated in the fear of
God. Even prudence would prohibit the use of such
artifices.[2]

Bishop Ketteler, Bishop of Maintz, urged that according
to the principle observed by the Fathers and
sanctioned by Councils, dogmatic decrees should only
be resorted to under imperative necessity. In many
districts the doctrine of Papal Infallibility was almost

[Footnote 1: Granderath.]

[Footnote 2: Friedrich, <i>Documenta</i>.]
-----File: p241.png--------------------------------------------------------
or altogether unknown to the faithful. Were it decreed,
many Catholics in this age of indifference would remain
within the Church without believing it, to the grave
detriment of Religion.

Bishop Hefele said that if the error of Gallicanism
consisted in separating the Church from the Pope, the
present proposal committed the converse error of
separating the Pope from the Church. We Catholics
can accept neither of these extreme positions. Moreover
we have been told that the subject of Infallibility
is the Church; we are now told that it is the Pope.
But it is difficult to see how these two subjects can
be united, unless the one renders the other superfluous,
and indeed excludes it. The theory of Papal Infallibility
seemed to him founded neither in Scripture nor in
History. The letter of Leo to Flavian was not accepted
by the fourth Ecumenical Council because it came
from an infallible writer, but because it contained an
apostolic doctrine; nor was it accepted until the doubts
of certain Bishops had been removed.

Another Bishop declared that if such Infallibility
were dogmatically defined, the result in his own diocese,
where not a trace of Tradition upon the subject existed,
would be grievous losses to the Church. Nor could he
personally profess himself convinced of it.

Melchers, Archbishop of Cologne, was prepared to
accept Papal Infallibility as his personal belief, but
was unable to assent to its erection into a dogma;
for he could see no necessity. The authority of the
Holy See was never greater than in modern times. And
it is neither customary nor expedient to impose new
dogmatic decrees without necessity. The subject of
Papal Infallibility in particular is a controverted subject.
Many learned and orthodox persons considered its
dogmatic definition impossible, owing to the serious
-----File: p242.png--------------------------------------------------------
difficulties presented by history and the writings of
the Fathers: the facts showing that there had never
been unanimity or universality of consent on this matter
in Christendom. Nor was it easy to see how a definition
could be composed which would not leave space for
numerous uncertainties and controversies as to its
meaning and application to past and future events.
And, among men disposed to accept the opinion,
there were many destitute of that certainty of
conviction which is an indispensable pre-requisite for
imposing the doctrine, without grave moral injury,
upon others as essential to be believed under penalty
of eternal damnation. There was no hope of real
unanimous consent; for it was impossible to deny that
a large proportion of the Bishops was adverse to the
definition. And hitherto in the Church of God it had
never been the custom, nor is it lawful, to establish
new dogmatic definitions without moral unanimity
among the Bishops assembled in Council.

Another Bishop insisted emphatically that no consideration
ought to move men to create an article
of faith, except only a clear knowledge that God has
revealed it, and that it is certainly contained in Scripture
or Tradition. For a Bishop to vote this doctrine merely
out of regard for the Holy See would be a mortal sin.
There was no constant Tradition for Infallibility. On
the contrary, the opposite opinion appears in numberless
records. St Augustine is particularly clear, and seems
to have had no conception whatever of the doctrine.
Bossuet's <i>Exposition</i> could not possibly have been
approved when the doctrine prevailed, for he only
mentions the primacy.

Another, who protests his abhorrence of all endeavours
to detract from the primacy of the Pope, was yet constrained
to plead that nothing should be said in this
-----File: p243.png--------------------------------------------------------
Council either concerning the pre-eminence of the Roman
Pontiff over the entire Church and General Council,
or concerning his Infallibility.

Another Bishop protested that this ascription to the
Pope of absolute or unconditional Infallibility, separate,
<i>i.e.</i> independent of the consent of the Episcopate--personal,
that is to say, uttered at will--is neither
opportune nor lawful: not opportune, for it will involve
souls and religion in innumerable difficulties; not lawful,
because founded on no certain argument either of
Scripture, or Tradition, or Councils; and because it
would revolutionise the constitution which Christ has
imposed upon His Church.

Next came a witness from the Irish Catholics. This
Bishop said that although during the last thirty-one years
before the Council assembled the doctrine of the Infallibility
of the Roman Pontiff had been taught in the Irish
schools, and he himself during fifteen years had inculcated
it upon the young ecclesiastics entrusted to his care; yet
for two hundred years it had always been taught in the
schools that the decrees of the Roman Pontiff were not
irreformable, except with the consent, either expressed
or tacit, of the Episcopate. Therefore this doctrine of
personal Infallibility of Roman Pontiffs could not reach
the people and sink into the minds of the faithful laity.
Moreover, a denial of personal Infallibility had been
publicly made when the Irish Bishops were interrogated
by the English Government. Nor was any censure to
this day ever uttered against the doctrine which prevailed
in Ireland. The Irish Catechisms had always
taught the Infallibility of the Church, meaning the
Bishops or teaching body in agreement with the Pope.

Sixteen other Bishops joyfully accept the doctrine,
and declare it supported by the entire Dominican Order.
Twenty-five others did the same.
-----File: p244.png--------------------------------------------------------

Another Bishop declared that the series of three
texts commonly quoted on behalf of Papal Infallibility
("Thou art Peter."... "I have prayed for thee" ... "Feed
My sheep") could not possibly prove that the authority
to teach and the privilege of Infallibility were given
exclusively to St Peter, for another series of texts exists
in which the Apostles collectively with St Peter are made
recipients of the same authority ("Go ye therefore ...
teaching them ... I will pray the Father, and He will
send you another Comforter ... Receive ye the Holy
Ghost"). Who will dare to say that the Apostles
and their successors received nothing in these words?
Who does not see that all power was directly
bestowed upon them all? Now, since the Bishops are
successors of the Apostles, and receive direct from
Christ a definite share in the government of the Church,
it is impossible to allow that the entire and absolute
authority and power to rule and teach, coupled with
the privilege of Infallibility, belong to the Pope alone.
Such power must reside in the Pope together with the
Episcopate, as the successor of Peter and the Apostles.
If the Pope possesses a principal portion of authority,
yet it is essentially limited by the rights of the Episcopate,
which are equally Divine. Thus it cannot be absolute.
We hold it for certain, this Bishop continued, that by
no argument from the first five centuries of the Church
can the Infallibility of the Pope be established. The
early centuries never recognised absolute infallible
teaching power in the Pope alone; but in the entire
Episcopate, of which he was the head. If nothing is
definable which does not conform to the test of universality
from the beginning, how can Infallibility of the
Pope ever become defined?

Another Bishop asserted that nothing more mischievous
than this unfortunate proposition could be conceived;
-----File: p245.png--------------------------------------------------------
nothing more dangerous to the authority of the Church
and the Holy See. It was not right to separate either
the head from the body nor the body from the head
in the discussion of this doctrine. Infallibility was a
prerogative of the entire body of the Church. The
difficulties which the doctrine of Papal Infallibility
create were endless and almost insoluble. The consequences
of a definition would be bad and dangerous.
It was therefore to be hoped that the Pope will, of his
own accord, set this cause of discord aside. Many of
the Fathers of the Vatican Council were persuaded that
such an example of humility and self-denial on the part
of the Pope would really increase the authority of the
Apostolic See, and render the name of Pius IX. glorious
in the annals of the Church.

Another member of the Council--Bishop Clifford, one
of the three candidates proposed by the Chapter for the
Archbishopric of Westminster, and who therefore, if the
will of the Roman Catholics in England had not been
overruled by Pius IX., might have been in Manning's
place--declared that the definition of this opinion as
of faith would be the greatest hindrance to the conversion
of Protestants and a stone of stumbling to
many Catholics. What good it could produce he was
unable to see. It would be especially disastrous in
England; for at the time of the Catholic emancipation
from civil disabilities the Bishops and theologians were
publicly questioned by Parliament whether English
Catholics believed that the Pope could impose definitions
on faith and morals apart from the consent, either tacit
or express, of the Church. All the Bishops, among them
the predecessor of the present Archbishop of Dublin,
together with the theologians, replied that Catholics did
not maintain this doctrine. This statement was entered
in the Parliamentary Acts. On the strength of these
-----File: p246.png--------------------------------------------------------
assertions, Parliament admitted the English Catholics
to civil liberty. How will Protestants believe that
Catholics are loyal to their honour and good faith if
they see them acquiring political advantage by professing
that Papal Infallibility is no part of the Catholic
religion, and afterwards, when those advantages are
secured, departing from their public profession and
asserting the contrary?

<tb>

Bishop Purcell, an American Bishop, was of opinion
that a definition of Papal Infallibility would be not only
inopportune but also dangerous. It would, if passed,
effectually frustrate conversions in the United States.
Bishops in controversy with Protestants will be unable
to refute them: for Protestants will say, "Hitherto
this doctrine was, so you asserted, an optional opinion
in the Church; now you declare it to be a dogma of
the faith. Either therefore your former assertion was
untrue, or the doctrine of the Church has suffered
variation. In which case, what becomes of your
objection to Protestant variations?"

Another Bishop, on the contrary, maintained that the
definition was not only opportune, but also necessary, in
order to deepen reverence for highest authority, and
to suppress the systematic rebellion which is very
widely spread. He desires that a Canon should be
formulated to anathematise all who hold the opposite
view.

Another Bishop declared that he could see no
necessity for any definition. If there were, eighteen
centuries would not have elapsed without one or other
of the Councils defining it. Nor could he see the least
utility. They who will not hear the Church certainly
will not hear the Pope. In the present discussion now
raging evil influences daily increase. There were many
-----File: p247.png--------------------------------------------------------
facts of history better buried in oblivion, which this
discussion proclaims abroad. So much for the opportuneness
of the dogma. What if the doctrine itself be
without secure foundation? Quite recently the Bishop
had vowed never to interpret Holy Scripture except in
accordance with the unanimous consent of the Fathers.
Now, previously to the Council, he had always interpreted
the text "I have prayed for thee" in the sense of Papal
Infallibility. But having begun to examine for himself,
for the purposes of the Council, he finds that nearly all
the extracts from the earlier Fathers given in theological
manuals in behalf of Infallibility (as in the works of
St Alphonso, Perrone, and others) are either inaccurate,
or derived from forgeries. What the extracts from the
early Fathers prove is primacy. They do not prove
Infallibility.

Conciliar definitions, says another Bishop, ought not
to be imposed by superior numerical force, but by
intellectual persuasion. In the Council of Trent so
great was the deference accorded to the minority that
a decision was postponed for several years because
thirty-seven of the Fathers declined to concur with the
opinion of the majority.

Another Bishop affirmed that in his view a definition
of Infallibility would be the suicide of the Church.
Quite recently, certain Anglicans, who six months ago
came over to Catholic unity, returned at once to
Anglicanism, on reading the Archbishop of Westminster's
imprudent Pastoral.

Bishop Kenrick made a very lengthy and elaborate
protest. He appealed to Augustine's defence of
Cyprian's opposition to Pope Stephen. Augustine
manifestly was ignorant of pontifical Infallibility, otherwise
he could not possibly have argued as he did.
The oft-quoted phrase, "Peter has spoken by Leo,"
-----File: p248.png--------------------------------------------------------
signified nothing more when originally uttered by the
Bishops at Chalcedon than that Leo's doctrine agreed
with their own convictions. In the Sixth Council at
Constantinople, the Archbishop of Constantinople, in
reference to the Letters of Pope Agatho, asked for
copies to compare with the traditional testimonies
of that Patriarchate; after which he would give his
reply. Accordingly the Archbishop compared the papal
letters; and, finding that their contents harmonised
with the Eastern teaching, accepted them. Moreover,
supreme papal authority does not include Infallibility.
Kenrick considered great differences to exist between
the dogma of Immaculate Conception and that of pontifical
Infallibility. The latter invades the rights of the
Episcopate, and imposes upon the faithful the necessity
of believing that Roman Bishops have never erred in
matters of faith, a statement which indisputable facts
of history appear to refute; and also of believing that
Roman Bishops will never err in future, which indeed
we hope, but are unable to believe as a certainty of the
faith. The rule to be followed is, that no innovation
should be accepted in the Church; that nothing should
be required of the faithful, except that which has been
believed always everywhere and by all.

When the ten days' interval was passed, and the
Council resumed its work, there was manifested on
the part of the authorities a decided hesitation. This
was due not to the protests of the minority, or to any
force in their numbers or their arguments. It was the
outcome of political rather than ecclesiastical causes.
For Italy aspired to become a consolidated kingdom,
with its capital at Rome. The entire mediæval inheritance
of the Papacy, the States of the Church, could not
be held by any force at the Pope's disposal; and might,
but for external protection, be at any moment swept
-----File: p249.png--------------------------------------------------------
away. That protection was provided by France.
French soldiers guarded the city, kept the Italians out,
and rendered the continuance of the Council possible.
The armed intervention of France was described by
the Archbishop of Paris[1] as a necessary expedient but
not a permanent solution. It provided a temporary
security, during which the Vatican Council was held.
It is impossible not to admire the sagacity which seized
the occasion. A little later, and it could not have been
done. But security depended on French goodwill.

"If any one dreams," said Antonelli, "that there
exists for us any human help, except the forces of
France, he must be blind."[2]

But France at this critical moment showed signs of
uneasiness. It felt that its protection was being utilised
for the promotion of theories which it strongly disliked.[3]
Count Daru, head of the French Ministry, sent an
emphatic protest to Rome, in which he declared that
the adoption of Ultramontane theories could not but
alienate from Catholicism many whom it would be a
duty to win. The Holy See was making the relation
between the Church and the State more difficult and
strained. In particular, the work of the French Ministry
was thereby made exceedingly difficult. They would
soon have to discuss in the Chamber the presence of
French troops in papal territory. How can their
presence be justified if the Pope rejects the principles
of liberty which are essential to the very existence of
modern Governments? The writer confesses that he was
personally placed in a position most discouraging to a
devoted adherent of the Roman cause. Public opinion
in France was already amazed to find the Council

[Footnote 1: Guillermin, <i>Darboy</i>, p. 206.]

[Footnote 2: Bourgeois et Clermont, <i>Rome et Napoleon</i>, iii. p. 322 (1907).]

[Footnote 3: Ollivier, ii. p. 89.]
-----File: p250.png--------------------------------------------------------
imprisoned within the limits of a programme which
invaded the freedom of the Bishops. Nothing could
be more opposed to the ancient rules of the Church.
Never had the Holy See hitherto restricted, or rather
suppressed, the lawful independence which Councils
have always possessed in forming their own Congregations
and choosing their own officials and regulating
their own procedure. The history of these great
Assemblies offers no precedent for the forms imposed
to-day; and we have only too much reason to say
that deliberations so arranged and conducted will only
result in resolutions not to the real interest of the
Church.[1]

We can well understand that the receipt of such a
letter, from such a source, caused great uneasiness in
the Papal Court. No wonder if, at the critical moment,
when everything seemed in their grasp, they yet
hesitated and delayed. The question to be determined
at Rome was, What did this manifesto mean? Was
this present attitude serious? a prelude to actions
more serious still?[2] No wonder if Pius temporised,
and diverted the attention of his Council for the
moment to other themes. So the subject of faith was
reintroduced. However, on 11th April, a telegram was
received in Rome: "Daru resigned. Ollivier succeeds
him. Council free." That is to say, of course, free from
a papal point of view.

The fact was, that although Napoleon III. had no
desire to promote the extension of papal power, yet
in the weakness of the monarchy and increasingly
republican tendencies of France, he could not afford
to offend the Ultramontanes. He was therefore compelled
by a cruel irony to protect the Pope, and enable
him to reach the summit of absolute power. With-*

[Footnote 1: Ollivier, ii. p. 90.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> ii. p. 245.]
-----File: p251.png--------------------------------------------------------
*drawal from Rome while its Episcopate was assembled
would be a declaration of hostility to Catholicism upon
which France dared not venture.[1] Accordingly, the
political obstruction being now removed, the Presiding
Legate informed the Council that many Bishops had
petitioned the Pope to forego the consideration of all
other subjects, and to proceed at once to the discussion
of Papal Infallibility; and to these petitions the Pope
had assented.

To realise the situation fully it is now necessary to
fix attention on a select and powerful body at work
behind the Council--the famous Commission of Suggestions.
This was a select Committee of twenty-five,
including Cardinals, Patriarchs, Archbishops, all
appointed by the Pope; their momentous function
being to receive and criticise all suggestions of subjects
upon which the Council might deliberate. Nothing
could enter the Council at all until endorsed by this
Commission.

It was pointed out by Infallibilists that the members
of the Commission of Suggestions represented all
portions of the Catholic world: to which the minority
replied that whatever the geographical distribution, all
opinions were excluded except one. This was not
exactly accurate. But within the chosen twenty-five
were such advanced Ultramontanes as Cullen, Archbishop
of Dublin; Spalding, Archbishop of Baltimore;
Manning, Archbishop of Westminster; Dechamp, Archbishop
of Mechlin; Conrad Martin, Bishop of Paderborn;
Valerga of Jerusalem; Cardinals de Angelis and
Bonnechose; to say nothing of Antonelli.

An important member of the Commission of Suggestions
was Guibert, Archbishop of Tours. When consulted
by Pius IX. on the desirability of a Council, he had

[Footnote 1: Ollivier, i. p. 391.]
-----File: p252.png--------------------------------------------------------
confined himself in his reply to practical affairs. There
is a studious and, says his biographer,[1] deliberate silence
on the theme of Pontifical Infallibility. The theory
was his personal belief. He thought that, were it otherwise,
the Church would be inadequately furnished for
arresting heresies, since General Councils are intermittent
and occasional. "But whether it is opportune to make
a dogma of this truth--that," he wrote in 1870, "is by
no means clear to me." At the same time he added
that he would not have the least repugnance to subscribe
to such a decree. Accordingly Guibert, who was
thoroughly understood in Rome and highly valued, was
nominated member of the Commission of Suggestions.

Guibert himself gave the following interesting
account[2] of their deliberations at the critical hour
when the subject of Infallibility was brought before
them. The Congregation met in a chamber of the
Vatican under the papal apartments. Cardinal Patrizzi
presided. Guibert, as one of the senior Archbishops,
was placed next to the Cardinals.

/#
"The time had come for the famous question of Infallibility
to be submitted to the Congregation for proposals.
Its decision was anxiously expected. The Pope himself
had given orders that he should be informed of our
decision immediately afterwards.

"Cardinal Patrizzi, after opening the subject, proceeded
to interrogate, according to custom, the prelates
of the least distinguished rank. They had mostly prepared
their reply, and before voting delivered a thesis
on the authority of Holy Scripture, the Fathers, etc.
These discourses were pronounced or read in Latin.
When my turn came, not being accustomed to write
much, I had no prepared discourse, and being unused
to talk in Latin, should have had great difficulty in
giving exact expression to my thoughts in that

language. I could, indeed, have given my vote in
Latin, but I desired to preface it with some statements
by way of explanation. I therefore begged the presiding
Cardinal to allow me to speak in French, which
was a language familiar to all the Congregation, and
which would greatly facilitate my explanations. The
Cardinal willingly consented, and, I may add that
many of my colleagues, being in the same predicament,
afterwards followed my example. They seemed to
attach some importance to what I was about to say.
I was far from desiring to oppose the definition for
which people yearned. I was by no means in with the
opposition, but I had never manifested enthusiasm for
it as many others did.

"I began with the profession of faith in the Pope's
Infallibility. I affirmed that this belief had been mine
throughout my life. I had been taught it in childhood,
and as a student I was admitted into a society where
this belief was held without reserve. I had taught it
myself as Superior of the Seminary of Ajaccio. In
short, I never had the least doubt about the doctrine,
and I was inclined to defend it in every way. But
the question before them now was whether it was
opportune for the Council to discuss its dogmatic
definition. If this question had been raised some years
before I should have asked that no discussion should be
held.... I hold that it would not have been opportune
to discuss the subject some years ago. It would have
been even dangerous, for it would have needlessly
disturbed the minds of men, and have exposed to
challenge an authority which more than any other
should remain above discussion. But things are different
to-day. The subject has taken possession of the public
Press, and violent passions have been roused by its discussion.
Deplorable divisions have been encouraged. The
faithful are everywhere disturbed. Even Governments
are uneasy; and, with various motives, concern themselves
with this important matter. Things have come to
such a pass that it is essential to bring the discussion
to an end. We are no longer free to keep silence. Peace

will only be restored by a definition of that which
Catholics have believed to the present day. We must
therefore treat the subject; and, I would add, must
decide in the affirmative. For otherwise, in the face of
existing circumstances, if this subject be not discussed,
serious harm will be done to the faithful. Governments
will not have the respect they should for the Holy See,
and the authority of the Pope will be depreciated.

"While I was delivering my speech," adds Guibert,
in a most significant conclusion to this account, "I was
watching Cardinal Antonelli, who was seated opposite.
And I saw him give indications of approval each time
I emphasised my opinions. My discourse produced a
considerable effect upon my colleagues. It seemed to
be new light, assisting and strengthening those who were
irresolute on the proper course to pursue. Prelates
who spoke after me did me the honour to base themselves
upon the reasons I had propounded, and the
conclusion of our meeting was that the subject should
be laid before the Council.

"As soon as our deliberations were ended, the
Cardinals went to the Pope and reported to him all
the incidents. They said that, thanks to the Archbishop
of Tours, a favourable vote had been obtained. The
Holy Father expressed his keen satisfaction."[1]
#/

Such was Guibert's important share in promoting the
great result. If his health gave way in Rome and
compelled him to leave before the issue was determined,
he could well be spared, for he had done his work. It
was appropriate that so influential a mover in the Congregation
of Proposals should afterwards be selected for
the Archbishopric of Paris, and the rank of Cardinal.

But to whom should the task be intrusted[**P2: entrusted] of
introducing the great subject into the Council itself?
There was a personage singularly fitted for this difficult
work. One of the most active spirits in Rome was

[Footnote 1: Follenay, <i>Vie de Cardinal Guibert</i>, ii[**.] p. 426.]
-----File: p255.png--------------------------------------------------------
Mgr. Pie, Bishop of Poitiers. His antecedents were,
from a curialist standpoint, irreproachable. He was,
says his Ultramontane biographer, "very Roman."
Already he had laboured to propagate the distinctive
Roman doctrines in five provincial Councils in France;
had taught the Infallibilist opinion twenty years; had
suggested suitable theologians of the proper school for
preliminary service in Rome. The Bishop of Poitiers
had impressed upon his clergy his theory of the relation
of Mary to the Councils of the Church. The Council
of Jerusalem, he informed them, was "honoured with
her presence," and she had never been absent from the
Council Chambers since. He suggested as a fruitful
subject for spiritual reflection, "Mary and the Councils."
The Vatican Assembly deserved better than any to
be associated with her name, for was it not opened on
the Festival of her Immaculate Conception? Mgr. Pie
had known perfectly well at least a year that Pontifical
Infallibility was bound to come up for discussion in the
Vatican deliberations. While still residing in his own
episcopal city, his Roman correspondents had informed
him that the preliminary Commission in Rome was
entirely agreed on the definability and opportuneness
of the doctrine. And he himself had publicly repudiated
the notion that Papal Infallibility depended for its
completeness upon at least the tacit consent of the
Episcopate. That the Bishop's own silence and that
of his colleagues conferred upon Peter's doctrinal utterances
a value not obtainable from Christ's promise,
and from the help of the Spirit, was to Mgr. Pie unthinkable.
And he administered a public rebuke to Bishop
Maret, the learned advocate of the opposite view, through
the medium of a sermon on the text, "the servant of God
must be teachable."[1] The superb confidence of Mgr. Pie

[Footnote 1: <i>Acta</i>, p. 1263.]
-----File: p256.png--------------------------------------------------------
greatly impressed the statesman Ollivier,[1] who said that
there was nothing like it on the other side.

Mgr. Maret replied to the sermon, and the preacher
issued a rejoinder.[2] But the strength of the Bishop
of Poitiers did not lie in argument. He had no learning
to measure with that of Maret. He was given to
rhetorical and fervid declamation; whereas Maret was
measured, historical, deliberate. Bishop Pie accordingly
escaped from further discussion in a letter to
his clergy, in which he registered a resolution not to
allude again to the recent work of a prelate whose
character he admired, but whose errors he lamented.
Refutation was, he maintained, superfluous, since Maret
only repeated his mistakes; and in fact answers to
the work were appearing daily. At the same time
Bishop Pie cannot resist asserting that the work of
Bishop Maret deserves all theological censures short
of formal heresy. To which he adds a prediction,
fully justified by events, that Maret would abandon
his errors and submit himself to the judgment of the
Church.

Already in Rome this "advocate of Roman doctrines
in their extremest form"[3] had acted consistently with
these antecedents. He had been long since cordially
received by the Pope, and warmly commended for his
diocesan utterances. The special honour had been
his of selection to the important Commission on Faith
by almost the highest number of votes. Already he
had preached in Rome, and told his hearers that they
had sown much and reaped little, since two or three
false lights had misguided men and disturbed the vision
even of the wise. Nevertheless he bade them be of good
courage. For two or three new definitions of principle

[Footnote 2: <i>Acta</i>, p. 1277.]

[Footnote 3: Ollivier, i. p. 415.]
-----File: p257.png--------------------------------------------------------
would make their children more powerful for good than
they themselves had ever been.

It is true that the diocese of Poitiers was by no
means free from tendencies of the opposite school.
The Bishop received from Catholics of his own flock
letters filled with objections against these Roman
doctrines with which for twenty years he had indefatigably
laboured to feed them. Accordingly, for a
while, he steered a diplomatic course between the
opposing extremes. When the majority presented a
petition, asking the Pope to introduce forthwith the
question of Pontifical Infallibility into the Council's
discussions, Mgr. Pie was not to be found among the
petitioners. There were reasons for this precaution.
The immediate introduction of the theme would violate
the logical development of thought. For certainly the
Church itself should be considered before the subject
of the Pope. While, therefore, the Bishop of Poitiers
was widely remote from sympathy with those who
desired the doctrine's indefinite postponement and
ultimate suppression, he fully sympathised with the
desire to set the doctrine in its logical place. He
thought it would be stronger there than it possibly
could be if torn out of its context, and arbitrarily and
disconnectedly introduced. Hence he did not explicitly
associate himself at first with this urgency movement
of the majority. He shared their belief but not their
impatience.

However, tactful and sagacious as ever, and keenly
alive to the direction in which the stream of popularity
flowed with increasing volume, Mgr. Pie was much too
prudent to oppose a lengthy reluctance to the wishes
of his intimate partisans. His conversion to the view,
that so urgent a matter required immediate treatment,
was shortly announced. He adopted the vulgar reproach
-----File: p258.png--------------------------------------------------------
against the minority: "what they labelled inopportune
they have rendered inevitable." He identified himself
with the irritating assertion that the responsibility for
the definition was due to its opponents. Of that, he
said, he had not the slightest doubt. He was now to
influence the Council itself. To whom could the task of
introducing the pontifical claims into the Council be
better intrusted than to him? An Infallibilist who had
not signed the petition for Infallibility would be more
calculated to disarm opposition. The Bishop's friends
in France were enchanted. An episcopal colleague just
returning from Lourdes wrote to him enthusiastically
in terms redolent of the ardent piety of that place:
"The Pope has said to Mary, You are immaculate.
And now Mary answers the Pope, And you are
infallible."

The Bishop of Poitiers set about his speech. He
walked with Pius IX. himself in the gardens of the
Vatican. He spent much time in serious discussion
with the Jesuit theologians Schrader and Franzelin.
Such were the influences at work upon his imagination.
It was a delicate task, as his Ultramontane biographer
justly observes, to introduce such a subject before an
Assembly so divided. To do it to the satisfaction of
the opposing extremes was of course impossible. The
speech of an hour and five minutes, in which this great
theory was launched upon the Council, received the
sharpest criticism of learned Germany, and the warmest
congratulations of the majority and the presiding
Cardinals. On the following day the Pope himself
alighted from his carriage to meet the orator, and
expressed the liveliest satisfaction. "<i>Bene scripsisti de
me</i>," said Pius IX.--an allusion, observes the biographer,
to the words which our Lord was reported to have
spoken to St Thomas Aquinas, in commendation of
-----File: p259.png--------------------------------------------------------
his theological labours. In course of time the orator
was raised to the Cardinalate.

Nothing can better reveal the effect of this announcement
on the minority than the terms in which the
Archbishop of Paris denounced it in a letter to
Cardinal Antonelli,[1] the Papal Secretary of State.

/#
"This discussion of Papal Infallibility before all the
other questions which must necessarily precede it, this
reversal of the proper and regular procedure of the
Council, this impulsive haste in a subject of the utmost
delicacy, which by its very nature required deliberation
and calm--all this," said the Archbishop, "was not only
illogical, absurd, incredible, but it plainly betrayed
before the world a resolve to coerce the Council, and
was, to describe it correctly, utterly inconsistent with
the freedom of the Bishops. To persist in this design
would be nothing less than a scandal before the whole
world. Those who advocate such excesses are plainly
blind to considerations of prudence. There is such a
thing as a justice and public good faith which cannot be
wounded with impunity.

"I say from the depth of inner conviction," exclaimed
the Archbishop,[2] that if decrees are passed by such
methods as these, occasion will be given for the gravest
suspicions as to the validity and freedom of the Vatican
Council.

"That decrees <i>can</i> be passed this way is indisputable,"
he added. "You can do anything by force of numbers
against reason and against right. But there is the
sequel to be considered. It is then that troubles will
arise for yourselves and for the Church."
#/

Now the writer of this fervid denunciation was conspicuous
for acuteness, tact, reserve, discretion, self-control.
What it meant for such a nature to speak
this way may be imagined. Nothing can better show

[Footnote 1: Quirinus, p. 854.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 856.]
-----File: p260.png--------------------------------------------------------
the intense strain on the feelings of the minority
than the fire and passion in this utterance of one
of the coldest of their number.

<tb>

The Archbishop's warning produced no practical
effect.

A French pamphlet,[1] entitled "The Freedom of the
Council and Infallibility," said to be the work of the
Archbishop of Paris, gives an extremely powerful
description of the situation in Rome, from the minority
standpoint, on the 1st of June. Only fifty copies were
printed, and it was intended exclusively for circulation
among the Cardinals.

/#
"Wide-spread complaints exist," says the writer,
"that the Council is not free. This is momentous, for
it affects its ecumenicity. Some indeed assure us that
all is well since the Pope is free. This is not the
Catholic conviction, and will only satisfy one side.
It is useless to bid us observe a respectful silence.
The integrity of history must be secured against party
spirit. Moreover we have now reached the second
period of the Council's activities.

"From the very beginning Papal Infallibility has been
the main affair. To-day it has become the only interest.
The time for concealment is past. The Council has
only been assembled for this end. And now the Pope
has postponed all other considerations and proceeds
to throw this doctrine suddenly and irregularly into
their midst. This is an amazing act of sovereign
authority, a sort of <i>coup d'état</i>. Nevertheless, it has
been throughout the aim, although the secret aim, of
the Assembly at the Vatican. The majority declares
the doctrine to be urgently necessary. But why this
urgency? A question which without peril to the Church
has waited eighteen hundred years might possibly still
afford to wait, at least for months. Precipitation,

[Footnote 1: Friedrich, <i>Documenta</i>.]
-----File: p261.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
urgency, are unbecoming in a problem demanding above
all things the calm gravity, deliberateness, freedom,
which alone befit representatives of an eternal Church.
The probability of an interruption of the Council before
anything is decreed is a miserable subterfuge. Is it really
believed that the majority is accidental and could not
be counted upon again?

"What appears to us most serious in this <i>coup d'état</i>
is not so much the disordering of the Council's regular
work, as the proof thereby displayed of an arbitrary
and absolute will, determined to override everything
in order to secure an end long since designed although
long concealed.

"Certainly those who urge the Holy Father to such
extremes take upon themselves a most tremendous
responsibility. Considering the circumstances (especially
the doubts already raised as to the Council's freedom),
under which they have demanded and secured an
exercise of supreme authority, placing so many venerable
Bishops in the dilemma of a struggle with the
Pope or with their own consciences, we cannot refrain
from the enquiry, What future do they expect will
await this assembly of the Vatican?

"The Council has now resumed its labours under new
Regulations. Undoubtedly these will facilitate rapidity.
But the aim of a Council is not rapidity, but truth. If
the speed is increased, it is at the price of the freedom
of the Bishops; at the price of real deliberation; of the
dignity and security of the Church. The new Regulations
on Procedure had provoked a protest from one
hundred Bishops of the minority: they feel themselves
burdened by intolerable restrictions. They find
themselves completely under the control of the
Presidents, of the Commissions, of the majority. And
behind all these there is the perpetual intervention of
the Pope himself. The Presidents control absolutely
the order of the day, the length of the Sessions, the
regularity of meetings, the intervals for the study of
documents. The Council, under such dominion, has
no life of its own, and no power of initiative. It has
#/
-----File: p262.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
no liberty. Is there," asks the writer, "any deliberative
assembly in Europe or America similarly restricted?
And yet the necessity of freedom is more imperative
here than in any assembly in the world, considering
the eternal interests here involved.

"The minority feel themselves still more crippled
by the power of numbers. There exists a majority
and a minority; unequal in numerical strength, but
far more equal considering the Churches which they
represent. The composition of this majority raises
serious thoughts. The Council includes, besides diocesan
Bishops, whose right alone is indisputable, Bishops with
no diocese; Vicars Apostolic, dependent on Rome and
removable at will; Cardinals who are not Bishops and
some not even priests; superiors of religious Orders."
According to the author, the proportion whose right of
membership was uncertain amounted to 195. "Moreover
the preponderance of Italian influence is shown in the
fact that it is represented by 276 Bishops, while all the
rest of Europe has only 265. A considerable proportion
of Bishops are being maintained by the Pope, which
increases the difficulties of real independence.

"If it be said that decision by majorities is the method
of all deliberative assemblies, the answer is, that this is
not true of a Universal Council of the Church; least of
all can it be permissible with an Assembly so constituted
as that of the Vatican. Creation of dogmas
by such a method is impossible. It has never been
done in the Church. And, accordingly, the protest of
a hundred Bishops declares that moral unanimity alone
can determine dogmatic questions. So serious they
declare is this matter that unless their protest against
the New Regulations be attended to, and that without
delay, their consciences will be burdened with intolerable
difficulties. A hundred Bishops say this. And
they have secured no reply whatever. The perplexities
resulting from this treatment may be well imagined.
Certainly the function of an Episcopal minority in a
Council is no sinecure. Some desired at once to withdraw
altogether. Others, and these the more numerous,
#/
-----File: p263.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
were reluctant to take this final step. Which of the
two was the wiser course the future will show."
#/

The author complains still further of pressure exerted
from without; of ordinary priests encouraged by Roman
influences to make declarations in favour of Infallibility
against their Bishops--a sort of novel Presbyterianism
in which the Bishop's testimony to the faith is superseded
by a section of his clergy. More serious still is
the personal intervention of the Pope. A powerful
moral pressure is brought to bear upon the Bishops
by Pius IX. Bellarmine wrote a courageous letter to
Clement VIII., counselling him not to influence the
assembled theologians with the weight of his personal
opinions, nor to bestow his favours and coveted distinctions
exclusively upon those who thought as he
did, but to leave all men in these serious discussions to
the unimpeded expression of his own belief. Certainly
Pius IX. had met with other advisers, and Bellarmine
has no equivalent in the Vatican of to-day. Semi-official
papers ascribed to the Pope a sentiment of
dignified reserve on the question of his Infallibility.
But, as a fact, every movement in that direction
has received papal blessings and encouragement. An
astonishing number of briefs has been issued from the
secretariat of latin letters. Each tract in favour of
Infallibility is commended. Thus the subject before
the Council is prejudged, and the minority bishops
themselves indirectly attacked.

The author's conclusion is that the character of the
Council is seriously compromised, and its freedom more
than questionable.

<i>The general discussion</i>[1] of Infallibility began on the
13th of May, and continued to the 3rd of June. No

[Footnote 1: <i>Acta</i>; Ollivier, ii. p. 279.]
-----File: p264.png--------------------------------------------------------
less than sixty-four Bishops desired to speak upon it.
Their names are known, but their speeches, with few
exceptions, are only known in fragments. They all
exist of course in the shorthand reports stored in the
Vatican archives, but they have not yet appeared.
This remains for a future historian. Meanwhile, we
know fairly well what Manning said, and we have in
full the speech of the Archbishop of Paris.

The Archbishop of Paris discussed three points:
the introduction, the contents, and the results of this
proposed decree. Two facts might show whether its
introduction into the Council was in accordance with
the principles and dignity of such an Assembly.

One fact was, that while Papal Infallibility was
obviously the real object for which the Vatican Council
was assembled (as indeed the creation of a new dogma is
the most momentous act a Council can perform), nevertheless
this momentous subject was never mentioned
in the official documents. And this omission was
natural. For the Catholic world had no desire for a
settlement of the question; nor was there any real
ground for meddling with what had hitherto always
been a subject of free enquiry among theologians.

The second fact was the introduction of the subject
into the Council completely out of its logical and
natural order. It was not logical to begin the doctrine
on the Church with a definition on the Papacy; for the
Infallibility of the Church must clearly be considered
prior to that of the Pope.

So far as to its introduction. As to its subject
matter: the substance of the formula before the
Council contained ambiguous expressions, and was full
of difficulty. Under what conditions is this Infallibility
supposed to be exercised? By what external signs
can we rest assured that the Pope is discharging the
-----File: p265.png--------------------------------------------------------
office of supreme teacher of Christendom? Is the
consent of the Episcopate required or not? If it is,
then men are fighting a shadow, for this is the doctrine
universally received; if it is not required, then they are
introducing an unheard-of and intolerable innovation.
But when a formula free from ambiguities has been
discovered, then two conditions must be fulfilled:
First, the formula, when discovered, must be proved
by solid arguments from Scripture, from the Fathers,
from the Councils. It must be shown that no important
historic incidents conflict with it, that no papal act
refutes it. The Archbishop referred to the Council of
Constance as an example in which the statement that
"every lawfully convoked Ecumenical Council representing
the Church derives its authority immediately from
Christ, and every one, the Pope included, is subject to
it in matters of faith," was unanimously decreed. The
Italian School, of course, would deny the ecumenical
character of this decree. "That," says the Archbishop
of Paris, "I do not admit." Moreover, in any case it
would show the common opinion of the Bishops. All
these questions, urged Darboy, would have to be considered
and weighed. Until the necessary proofs are
forthcoming nothing can rightfully be done. There is
no peril in delay. But to impose irrevocably on the
consciences of the faithful a decree with precipitation,
and without absolute certainty, would be the gravest
peril that can be conceived.

As to the practical results of such a decree the Archbishop
observed that Papal Infallibility was offered as
a means for strengthening authority and unity in the
Church. But it must be remembered that the ideal
of authority in Christendom is not that which our
imagination or our reason represents as most desirable;
but that which Christ has established and our fathers
-----File: p266.png--------------------------------------------------------
maintained to this day. It is not our function to
reconstruct the Church after our taste, or to alter the
conditions of divine ordaining. Now the Church has
never been without its essential elements. But it has
never had a definition of Papal Infallibility. Such
definition cannot therefore be essential. Nor have
men the right to argue that the Church's unity would
be firmer if authority were stronger. An institution
may be ruined by over-pressure. Excessive concentration
may paralyse its functions rather than perfect them.

Then, again, the remedy for the evils of the world
is not to be found in Papal Infallibility. This doctrine
will not draw to the Church the alienated majority;
nor give the Church its rightful place of influence
among the nations. The world is sick and perishing,
not for want of knowing the truth, but for want of
love for it. If it reject the truth now when presented
by the collective testimony of the Church, it will not
any the more accept it because affirmed by one
infallible voice. And what is the value of a proclamation
if it is not received? of an anathema where the
formulating authority is not acknowledged?

The Archbishop evidently spoke with constraint.
His measured, diplomatic utterances suggest the firmness
and caution of one desirous not unnecessarily to
offend yet resolute to speak his mind. He told the
Council that he had delivered his conscience, so far
as was allowed him; that if he were to say all he
would outrun the limits of discretion. He concluded
by proposing, first, to postpone the scheme as having
been introduced in a manner unworthy of the Council;
secondly, to reconsider more carefully the nature
and limits of Infallibility; and, finally, to set aside
the subject altogether as fraught with dangerous results
to Christendom.
-----File: p267.png--------------------------------------------------------

The Congregations were occupied with daily lengthy
speeches for and against the doctrine of Infallibility
from 13th May to 3rd June. On 3rd June the Presidents
produced a petition signed by many Bishops, requesting
that the debate might be closed. The Council was
accordingly invited to express its opinion, and the large
majority decided that the time for closure was come.
Thus again the minority were defeated.

Little more remained to be done. The special discussion
followed. But the matter was approaching its
close. The minority grew more spiritless and anxious
for self-protection. The intense heat of the Roman
summer told fearfully on the health of Bishops
accustomed to northern climes. Appeals to the Pope
for adjournment until autumn were rejected. The
futility of protracted discussion became convincingly
clear to the minority no less than to the majority.[1]
A desperate attempt was made by some French Bishops
(Dupanloup and the Archbishop of Paris) to induce
the Emperor Napoleon to request the Pope, in the
name of humanity and reason, to prorogue the Council
until October. But before the reply could arrive the
minority abandoned the struggle.[2]

Many Bishops resigned their turn to speak. A
movement for closure arose, instigated chiefly by
Manning: at first resisted, the minority gradually
acquiesced.

Ultimately, amid general approval, the presiding
Cardinal declared the discussion closed. On the 13th
of July the proposition of Papal Infallibility was put
to the vote.[3] The President announced that 601 Fathers
had voted. Of these 451 were in favour, 88 against,
and 62 favourable conditionally.[4]

[Footnote 1: Ollivier, ii. p. 329.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Acta</i>, p. 756.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Acta</i>, p. 758.]

[Footnote 4: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 760.]
-----File: p268.png--------------------------------------------------------

The Legates further announced that the conditional
votes would be taken into consideration, and reported
upon in the next Congregation. Ninety-one Bishops
also abstained from voting, although in Rome at the
time.[1] When the members re-assembled on Saturday,
16th July, a report was made on the conditional
votes and the amendments; but so far from anything
being done to conciliate the minority, the wording of
the decree was made somewhat more uncompromising
than before. To the definition voted on the 13th,
that the decrees of the Roman Pontiff were irreformable
of themselves, it was now added "and not by
consent of the Church," thus emphasising still more
strongly that the dogmatic authority of the Papacy
was independent of the entire Episcopate.[2] After this
stupendous achievement the Presidents informed the
Bishops that, although the Council was not prorogued,
a general permission was granted them to return to
their dioceses until 11th November (St Martin's Day).[3]

The final Public Session at which the Pope proposed
to convert the formula into dogma of faith was fixed
for Monday, 18th July. There was for the minority
certainly no time to lose. They made one last
attempt.[4] On the Saturday evening a deputation of the
opposition, including two Cardinals and the Archbishops
of Paris and Milan, went to the Vatican and sought
an audience with the Pope. After waiting an hour,
they were admitted at nine o'clock.[5] The Archbishop
of Paris was their representative. In his own name,
and in that of his associates, he declared his submission
to the doctrine of Infallibility, but requested
the insertion of the phrase, "relying on the testimony
of the Churches." This phrase would have acknow-*

to be part of the Catholic faith.[1] It would have made
the dogma much less difficult to many members of the
Roman Church. It would have relieved the strange
and incredible isolation in which the new formula had
placed the Pope--as apart from, independent of, the
universal consciousness of Christendom. It would have
suggested that the Pope represented and voiced the
collective conviction of the Church, on whose testimony
he was relying. But this was not the Ultramontane
idea. And there is no occasion for surprise if Pius IX.
rejected it. One more appeal was made to him.
Ketteler,[2] Bishop of Maintz, threw himself on his knees
before the Pope, and with his eyes full of tears implored
Pius to make some concession which would restore
peace to the Church and to the Episcopate. It is
a striking scene. Two conceptions of the Church
are embodied in these two men: in Pius, the
modern Ultramontane conception of absolute authority
centralised and condensed in one individual; in his
suppliant, the ancient Cyprianic conception of authority
residing in the Collective Episcopate. In the attitude
of the two men, the historian may see the old vainly
pleading with the new for permission to exist; lifelong
believers reduced to self-contradiction as the price of
permission to remain. It was this scene which provoked
a Roman contemporary[3] to say:--

character of foreign nations, but as credulous as a

#/

Frustrated in that last appeal, the deputation returned
to their party. A meeting was held very late on the
Saturday night.[1] What should the minority do? The
bolder spirits proposed that they should attend the
Public Session, and openly repeat their rejection of
the doctrine. But the bolder spirits were few. Many
shrank from such resolute action. They held it inconsistent
with respect for the Pope to pronounce a public
protest in his presence at the final Session when the
doctrine would be proclaimed. They had misgivings
as to the number who had the courage for such a stand.
Diminishing numbers added point to this misgiving.
Many Bishops had already left the city, others were
going. Was it prudent to appear in protest shorn of
their real numerical strength? Moreover, there were
personal anxieties and fears. What if in the Public
Session their protest was over-ruled? The determination
of the majority to decree the dogma at any cost
was now beyond dispute. Illusion was impossible. The
formidable anathema attached to the decree might in
another forty-eight hours apply to themselves. They
were very uneasy in the papal precincts. They would
infinitely prefer to take refuge in the safety of their
own cathedral cities, far away from the entanglements,
oppressive atmosphere, moral as well as physical, in
Rome. Consequently caution prevailed. They composed
a letter to the Pope, the last of their many
futile protestations, couched in terms of deference, but
registering their continued allegiance to their ancient
principles. And by Sunday evening most of the seventy
Bishops, representatives of some of the most illustrious

[Footnote 1: Ollivier, ii. p. 343.]
-----File: p271.png--------------------------------------------------------
Sees in Christendom, had left the city, and hastened
away beyond the territorial dominions of Rome.

The last letter of the defeated minority called the
Pope's attention to the number of disapproving prelates.[1]
To the eighty-eight who voted in the negative must be
added the sixty-two others who expressed themselves
dissatisfied; and, beyond these, another seventy who
absented themselves, although present in Rome, and
others still who had already left the city. The large
element of disapproval would be obvious to the Pope, and
also to the world. Since the hour when they recorded
their vote against the doctrine, nothing had happened to
change their opinion: on the contrary, much to strengthen
it. Accordingly they now renew and endorse their
declaration. Under these circumstances they have
resolved to absent themselves from the Public Session of
the 18th; their reverence for the Holy See not permitting
them to proceed to an open refusal of a doctrine by
which the Pope was personally affected. They would
therefore leave the city and return to their dioceses
with expressions of unaltered faith and obedience.

Among the signatures to this letter are the names of
Cardinal Schwarzenberg; Darboy, Archbishop of Paris;
Scherr, Archbishop of Munich; Kenrick, Archbishop of
St Louis; Strossmayer, Bishop of Sirmium; Bishop
Maret, Bishop Clifford of Clifton, Bishop Dupanloup,
Bishop Hefele.[2]

This final letter of disapproval, which sixty of the
Bishops signed, was of course technically valueless.
All speeches, protests, and letters count for nothing
compared with the actual formal decision. If any
protest were to have validity, it must be made precisely
where the minority had not the courage to make
it--in the Council at the final Session; to frustrate the

[Footnote 1: <i>Acta</i>, p. 994.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 995.]
-----File: p272.png--------------------------------------------------------
impending decree. Yet, if it is strictly true that the
dogma was passed with practical unanimity of all
present, on the value of that unanimity opinions will
legitimately differ.

The conduct of the minority has been not unnaturally
severely criticised. They grew feeble, says Ollivier,[1] the
head of the French ministry, just in proportion as
actions ought to have taken the place of words. Their
arguments in their last consultation were weakness
itself. Not to renew their protest in the Public Session
was virtually to cancel the protest already made. It
insured for the decree just that unanimity which its
advocates desired, and which its opponents knew that
it did not possess. It was a confession that they dared
not utter Yes or No.[2]

Before Dupanloup left the city he sent the Pope a
letter[3] suggesting one last expedient for averting the
evils which a decree of Infallibility would involve. Let
the Pope personally decline to confirm the decree.
Let him say in the Public Session that he thankfully
recognises the remarkable tribute to the prerogatives of
his See, in the votes of so numerous an assembly of
Bishops; nevertheless, considering the circumstances,
and after mature reflection, he believes it more in accordance
with apostolic wisdom and prudence to withhold
his definite approval until a less disturbed and more
propitious time. Dupanloup assured the Pope that
this manœuvre would solve the problem, release men
unexpectedly at the last moment from incalculable misfortunes,
astonish the world, and win universal reverence
and admiration. This singular epistle terminated with
a promise to preserve inviolable silence on the advice
which he ventured to give.

The night passed. Early on the morning of the

[Footnote 1: Ollivier, ii. p. 341.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 343.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Acta</i>, p. 993.]
-----File: p273.png--------------------------------------------------------
eventful 18th of July, Dupanloup's reflections were
interrupted by a sudden exclamation from his travelling
companion, Archbishop Haynald, who sat at the
opposite corner of the carriage. "Monseigneur," said
Haynald, "we have made a great mistake." Dupanloup
had no heart for further discussion. He made a sign
that he wished to say his Office. Archbishop Haynald
was right. If, as Dupanloup told the clergy, Bishops
united in council with the Pope "decide questions as
witnesses of the faith of their Churches, as judges by
divine right"[1] it would seem to be not only their right,
but their very awful duty and inalienable responsibility
to allow no sentiment of respect for the office of
another to silence their convictions and frustrate their
decisions. Thus it is true that the minority melted
away, and that the ultimate proclamation was made
with practical unanimity; but this was due to a regard
for sentiment which was, under the circumstances,
wholly out of place. The Bishop who told his diocese
that the definition of such prerogatives demanded other
considerations than sentiment or filial piety, could not
consistently withdraw his testimony to the faith of the
Church just in the most critical moment that ever
awaited him.

Meanwhile in Rome the final declaration was made.
In the presence of his faithful majority, in the midst of
one of the fiercest storms ever known to break across the
city, accompanied by thunder and lightning, while rain
poured in through the broken glass of the roof close to
the spot where the Pope was standing, Pius IX. read
in the darkness, by the aid of a candle, the momentous
affirmation of his own Infallibility. Variously explained
by friend and foe, the storm and the darkness
are by the one compared to the solemn legislation on

[Footnote 1: <i>Letter to his Clergy</i> (1868), p. 11.]
-----File: p274.png--------------------------------------------------------
Sinai; by the other to tokens of divine displeasure and
approaching desolation. But whatever constructions
were placed upon the circumstance, the dogma decreed
indisputably declared that--

/#
"The Definition affirms that the Roman Pontiff, when
he speaks <i>ex cathedra</i>--that is, when in discharge of the
office of Pastor and Doctor of all Christians, by virtue of
his supreme Apostolic Authority, he defines a doctrine
regarding faith or morals to be held by the Universal
Church, by the divine assistance promised to him in
Blessed Peter--is possessed of that Infallibility with
which the Divine Redeemer willed that His Church
should be endowed for defining doctrine regarding faith
and morals. And that, therefore, such definitions of
the Roman Pontiff are irreformable of themselves and
not from the consent of the Church."[1]
#/

For a few more meetings the diminished Council
lingered on.[2] The eighty-seventh Congregation was
held on 13th August, when the total of Bishops present
was reduced to 136. Two further Sessions were held
on 23rd August and 1st of September, when the
numbers dwindled still further to 127 and 104. But
for all real purposes the Council met no more after
the fourth Public Session and the proclamation of
Infallibility.

CHAPTER XVIII


I

THE MINORITY AFTER THE VATICAN DECREE

The 18th of July 1870 is from any point of view one
of the most critical days in the history of the Papacy.
It is the transition from old Catholicism into new.
It is the consummation of a theory of spiritual authority;
the centralising and condensing of all power in one
individual. It is not in the least the necessary or the
logical conclusion of the principle of authority: for the
expression of authority, either through the Collective
Episcopate or through reception by the Universal
Church, is just as consistent and just as logical; and
has the additional advantage of corresponding with
the primitive facts of Christian history.

The 18th of July was also a momentous date in the
annals of the Roman temporal power. On the very next
day began the Franco-Prussian War. From that date
onwards the tragedy of conflict precluded any meeting
of German and French Bishops in Council at Rome.
The Council was necessarily interrupted, its resumption
indefinitely postponed. The disaster to France meant
the recalling of the French troops from Rome. Then
followed the capture of the city by United Italy, and
the establishment of the Italian Throne at the gates
of the Vatican. The temporal power of the Papacy
-----File: p276.png--------------------------------------------------------
vanished like a dream, and Pius IX. considered himself
a prisoner within the Vatican precincts. The canon
of the Castle of St Angelo announced the entry of
King Humbert, and various convents and palaces were
seized and confiscated for secular departments and
imperial uses.

A curious Italian comment on the opposition in the
French Episcopate may be found in the diary of
Cardinal Pitra, a learned member of the Benedictine
Order, resident during the Council in Rome. Cardinal
Pitra was librarian of the Vatican, and placed himself
in that capacity at the disposal of the Bishops. If he
kept aloof from the intrigues of every kind which, says
his biographer, were then so numerous, he kept a careful
diary of the events in which he displays himself
as a decided Ultramontane. He even adopted the
paradox that the passing of the new decree would
diminish rather than increase the abyss between the
Eastern Churches and Rome. But Pitra's comments
after the French retreat illustrates contemporary feeling.
He thought that the Franco-German War, which
immediately broke out, was providentially designed to
prevent concerted action between the Bishops of these
two countries. When the Italians entered Rome one
of their first acts was to destroy the villa where
Dupanloup during the Council had resided. This was,
according to Pitra, because Providence desired to efface
the reminders of opposition. Pitra traced the course of
the war, and noted how the soldiers advanced through
Metz, Rheims, Paris, and Orleans--all Gallican cities;
whereas they did not reach Besançon, Dijon, and
Marseilles--all Ultramontane Episcopates. "We are
here," murmurs the Cardinal, "witnesses to the preliminaries
of the Judgment Day."

Cecconi, Archbishop of Florence, who collected many
-----File: p277.png--------------------------------------------------------
documents concerned with the struggle, relates that
Pius IX. used to distinguish three periods of the
Council: the preparations; the assemblies; the conclusion.
Of these, the first period was Satanic, the
second Human, the third Divine.[1]

But before a minority Bishop could assent to the
new Decree, there were questions to be faced and
answered; questions which he must answer in his own
behalf, and which also he was certain to find assailing
him, whether from his Clergy or Laity, who like himself
had hitherto deprecated the doctrine or disbelieved it.
There was the question, perhaps, first of all, Is this
Council ecumenical? Is it a true exponent of the
Universal Church? There are Councils of many kinds,
with varying degrees of authority, legitimately responded
to with varying degrees of respect. Is this Council
of the highest kind--that which possesses a real and
absolute finality? This question was widely debated
within the Roman body. It was said by high authorities
in the Roman Communion that the Vatican Council
did not fulfil the conditions of freedom essential to the
creation of a dogma of the faith. Many writers of the
period assert this; some in the most impassioned
terms. Hefele emphatically declared it. Some affirmed
that moral unanimity was essential to representation of
the Universal Church. Such unanimity, it was notorious,
the vote for Infallibility did not possess. Accordingly
there was no rush of the defeated Bishops into immediate
acquiescence. On the contrary, there was suspense,
uncertainty, delay. Individual isolated Bishops took no
decided steps. They waited to see what others would
do, what time would produce, what thought and reflection
might suggest.

Fessler, indeed, late Secretary of the Vatican

[Footnote 1: Baunard, <i>Histoire de Cardinal Pie</i>, p. 353.]
-----File: p278.png--------------------------------------------------------
Assembly, assured them that their course was clear.
He drew a sketch of the conduct which he considered
would be ideal for a perplexed Bishop under these
trying circumstances.

/#
"If even up to ... the last General Congregation
before the Solemn Session a Bishop is not satisfied as
to all his difficulties, or if he thinks it better that the
decision should not yet be pronounced on such and
such a doctrine, he may, in the interval between the
last General Congregation and the Solemn Session,
acquire a full conviction on the subject by discoursing
with other theologians, by study of the subject and by
prayer, and may thus overcome his last difficulties,
and see that it is well that the definition should be
made."
#/

This portion of Fessler's advice was not much use
since it appeared subsequently to the final Session.
Whether the advice to "acquire a full conviction" in
the interval between the last General Congregation and
the Solemn Session would have been very valuable, may
be judged from the fact that the interval for "discourse
with other theologians," "study and prayer," was two
days. The subsequent struggles will show what the
minority Bishops thought of acquiring a full conviction
in two days.

Should, however, the best use of the interval prove
unavailing, Fessler's advice was as follows:--

/#
"Nay, even if he cannot attain this full conviction
and insight into the matter by any exertion of his own,
he will wait for the decision of the Council with a
calm trust in God, without himself taking part in it,
because up to this point he lacks the necessary certainty
of conviction. When, however, the Council by its
decision puts an end to the matter, then at length
his Catholic conscience tells him plainly what he must
#/
-----File: p279.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
now think, and what he must now do; for it is then
that the Catholic Bishop, whom hitherto unsolved
difficulties have kept from participation in the Public
Session, and from the solemn voting, says: '<i>Now</i> it
is undoubtedly certain that this doctrine is revealed
by God, and is therefore a portion of the Catholic faith,
and therefore I accept it on faith, and must now
proclaim it to my clergy and people as a doctrine of
the Catholic Church. The difficulties which hitherto
made it hard for me to give my consent, and to the
perfect solution of which I have not even yet attained,
<i>must</i> be capable of a solution; and so I shall honestly
busy myself with all the powers of my soul to find
their solution for myself, and for those whose instruction
God has confided to my care."
#/

Fessler omits all recognition of the possibility that
men if placed in a dilemma between Authority and
History may choose the latter. The effect of the Decree
on many Bishops was not in the least to compel the
confession, '<i>Now</i> it is undoubtedly certain that this
doctrine is revealed': rather it was to awaken the
criticism, now it is profoundly uncertain whether
this Council is ecumenical.

Such is Fessler's advice to Bishops who doubted the
truth of the doctrine. To those who only considered
its definition inopportune his counsel was:--

/#
"Those Bishops who in the last General Congregation
voted with the <i>non placets</i>, only because they really
thought it was not a good thing, not necessary, not
for the benefit of souls in countries well known to them,
and who for this reason abstained from taking part
in this decision, may after the solemn decision, if they
think it advisible[**], represent to the faithful of their
dioceses the position which they previously adopted
towards the doctrine, in order that their conduct may
not be misunderstood. But they must now themselves
#/
-----File: p280.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
unhesitatingly accept the doctrine which has been
decided, and make it known to their people in its true
and proper bearings, without reserve, and in such a
manner that the injurious effects which they themselves
apprehended may be as much as possible obviated and
removed; for it is not permitted to the Bishop, as the
divinely-appointed teacher of the clergy and people,
to be silent about or to withhold a doctrine of the Faith
revealed by God, because he apprehends or thinks that
some may take offence at it. Nay, rather it is his
business so prudently to bring it about in the declaration
of that doctrine, that its true sense and import
may hereafter be clearly represented, all erroneous
misrepresentations of it be excluded, the reasons for
the decision of the doctrine brought out plainly, and
all objections to it zealously met and answered."[1]
#/

No one gave greater weight to the obvious difficulties
which the methods employed at Rome had created
for the Decree, no one formulated them with more
simplicity and frankness than Dr Newman. His letters
showed how he laboured to suggest plausible grounds
for assent to the new Decree, while leaving the
ecumenical character of the Council for future solution.
And, remembering that these letters were addressed
to the believers and not to the outer world, nothing
can show more strikingly than the arguments which
Dr Newman employs, the profound perplexity into
which many Romanists were thrown.

In a letter[2] written six days after the Decree was
passed he says:--

/#
"I saw the new Definition yesterday, and am pleased
at its moderation--that is, if the doctrine is to be defined
at all. The terms are vague and comprehensive; and
personally I have no difficulty in admitting it. The
#/

[Footnote 1: Fessler, <i>True and False Infallibility</i>, p. 21.]

[Footnote 2: See Letter to Duke of Norfolk, pp. 96, 97, 98, 99.]
-----File: p281.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
question is, Does it come to me with the authority of
an Ecumenical Council?

"Now the <i>primâ[**typo for prima?] facie</i> argument is in favour of its
having that authority. The Council was legitimately
called; it was more largely attended than any Council
before it....

"Were it not then for certain circumstances under
which the Council made the definition, I should receive
that definition at once.

"Even as it is, if I were called upon to profess it,
I should be unable, considering it came from the Holy
Father and the competent local authorities, at once to
refuse to do so. On the other hand, it cannot be denied
that there are reasons for a Catholic, till better informed,
to suspend his judgment on its validity.

"We all know that ever since the opening of the
Council there has been a strenuous opposition to the
definition of the doctrine; and that, at the time when
it was actually passed, more than eighty Fathers
absented themselves from the Council, and would have
nothing to do with its act. But if the fact be so, that
the Fathers were not unanimous, is the definition valid?
This depends upon the question whether unanimity at
least moral is or is not necessary for its validity? As
at present advised I think it is....

"Certainly Pius IV. lays great stress on the unanimity
of the Fathers in the Council of Trent.... Far different
has been the case now--though the Council is not yet
finished. But if I must now at once decide what to
think of it, I should consider that all turned on what
the dissentient Bishops now do.

"If they separate and go home without acting as
a body, if they act only individually or as individuals,
and each in his own way, then I should not recognise
in their opposition to the majority that force, firmness,
and unity of view, which creates a real case of want
of moral unanimity in the Council...."
#/

But it is impossible not to feel that dogmas which
men are recommended to accept on such extenuating
-----File: p282.png--------------------------------------------------------
pleas, dogmas whose irregularity is acknowledged
so long as their validity is saved, dogmas which
depend for their acceptance on the melting away
of the episcopal minority, were evidently straining the
faith of Catholics almost to breaking point, or they
would never have been defended in such a manner.
Here is nothing of the devout thankfulness for fuller
enlightenment, or the triumph of truth; nothing of
the glad recognition of a decision guided by the Holy
Ghost. Newman could never have treated the Nicene
Council as he did the Vatican. Behind these endeavours,
to prevent secession or schism, lies Newman's recorded
conviction in his letter to Ullathorne.

Newman's theory that the ecumenical character of
the Council might be ascertained from its ultimate
acceptance, that acquiescence on the part of the defeated
minority would atone for any irregularities in the passing
of the Decree, by no means carried conviction to
many of the perplexed. The nature of the doctrine
decreed seemed to exclude this kind of defence. For
if the utterances of the Pope are infallible of themselves,
and not from the consent of the Episcopate, it is
difficult to base that Infallibility upon episcopal consent.
Instead of waiting to see what the Episcopate
might do it would appear more appropriate to consider
what the Pope had done. And in another letter
written within the same anxious month this is precisely
the view which Newman takes.[1]

/#
"I have been thinking over the subject which just
now gives you and me, with thousands of others, who
care for religion, so much concern.

"First, till better advised, nothing shall make me
say that a mere majority in a Council, as opposed to
a moral unanimity, in itself creates an obligation to
#/

[Footnote 1: See Letter to Duke of Norfolk, p. 98.]
-----File: p283.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
receive its dogmatic Decrees. This is a point of history
and precedent, and, of course, on further examination I
may find myself wrong in the view which I take of
history and precedent; but I do not, cannot see, that a
majority in the present Council can of itself <i>rule</i> its own
sufficiency without such external testimony.

"But there are other means by which I can be
brought under the obligation of receiving a doctrine
as a dogma."
#/

And he proceeds to enumerate uninterrupted tradition,
Scripture inference, etc. And then he propounds
the theory that "the fact of a legitimate Superior
having defined it, may be an obligation in conscience
to receive it with an internal assent.... In this case
I do not receive it on the word of the Council, but
on the Pope's self-assertion."

This he supports by an appeal to the historic
authority which the Pope has actually exercised, and to

/#
"the consideration that our merciful Lord would not
care so little for His elect people, the multitude of the
faithful, as to allow their visible Head and such a large
number of Bishops to lead them into error; and an error
so serious, if an error."
#/

No one can fail to be impressed with Newman's
painful consciousness of the Council's indefensible irregularities;
with his refusal to acknowledge a powerful
majority as equivalent to moral unanimity; with his
desire to see if the dogma cannot be accepted on other
grounds than the Council's authority, and in particular
on the Pope's self-assertion. All this would, of course,
be absolutely unconvincing to any adherent of the
ancient conception that the supreme authority is not
to be found in the Pope's self-assertion, but in the
Collective Episcopate. But it manifests profound misgivings
about the Vatican Council and its methods.
-----File: p284.png--------------------------------------------------------
The thought that the merciful Lord would not permit
His people to be led into error on so serious a subject
depends for its value on the solemn question, whether
the gifts of God are in any way conditional. If the
transmission of grace depends upon conformity to
conditions so also does the transmission of truth. If
human co-operation is necessary to the achievement of
human enlightenment, then the neglect of compliance
with these conditions, the refusal of that co-operation,
will be attended with serious losses which the merciful
Lord must not be expected to prevent. The graver
the misgivings created by the coercive methods of
the Vatican majority, the more urgent becomes the
enquiry, whether their refusal to comply with the true
conditions of conciliar freedom would not be punished
by the nemesis of a misleading Decree. Newman's
misgivings on the Council's integrity cancel his appeal
to the thought of the mercifulness of our Lord. This,
at any rate, is what many within the Roman Communion
undoubtedly felt. They did not believe in the
rightfulness of expecting Providence to nullify the
perverseness and self-will of an overwhelming majority[**.]

Subtle, attractive, bearing in every line of it the distinctive
impress of his wonderful personality, Newman's
defence is remarkable rather as a <i>tour de force</i> than for
argumentative solidity. Newman's personal assent to
the dogma was indisputably complete. He said,
indeed, all that it was possible to say. But even his
brilliant genius could scarcely efface the effect of his
own letter written to Bishop Ullathorne before the
dogma was passed.

/#
"Moreover," he wrote, "a letter of mine became
public property. That letter ... was one of the most
confidential I ever wrote in my life. I wrote it to my
own Bishop under a deep sense of the responsibility I
#/
-----File: p285.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
should incur were I not to speak out to him my whole
mind. I put the matter from me when I had said my
say, and kept no proper copy of the letter. To my
dismay I saw it in the public prints: to this day I do
not know, nor suspect, how it got there. I cannot
withdraw it, for I never put it forward, so it will remain
on the columns of newspapers whether I will or not;
but I withdraw it as far as I can by declaring that it
was never meant for the public eye."
#/

Certainly it needed no assurance from the writer to
convince us that this letter was not designed for
publicity. It is equally impossible not to feel that in
that letter we have the writer's mind in its full expression.
The very fact that it was never meant for the
public eye means that it was written without that
caution and restraint imposed by watchful critics and
extremist partisans always ready to pounce upon
Newman and denounce him as a minimiser at Rome.
Thus we have his frankest declaration here. And that
declaration was much too frank to be convenient. It
naturally hampered him now that the doctrine was
decreed. A certain inconsistency was required of him,
and is reflected in his letters. Before the Council decreed
he wrote[1] of the disputed doctrine, "I have ever thought
it likely to be true; never thought it certain." After the
decision he wrote:[2] "For myself, ever since I was a
Catholic, I have held the Pope's Infallibility as a matter
of theological opinion; at least I see nothing in the
definition which necessarily contradicts Scripture,
Tradition, or History." Before the decision he wrote:
"If it is God's will that the Pope's Infallibility be
defined, then it is God's will to throw back the times
and moments of the triumph which He has destined

[Footnote 1: Thureau Dangin, Letter to Ward, iii. p. 119.]

[Footnote 2: Letter to Duke of Norfolk, p. 99.]
-----File: p286.png--------------------------------------------------------
for His kingdom." After the decision he wrote: "For
myself I did not call it inopportune, for times and
seasons are known to God alone ... nor in accepting
as a dogma what I had ever held as a truth, could I
be doing violence to any theological view or conclusion
of my own."[1] No one will scrutinise too closely, or
make exacting demands of rigorous self-identity, in
letters written in the strain of so vast a change as that
which the new Decree had wrought. Yet the various
statements are part of the evidence to the effect
produced, by the doctrine, upon the gifted mind then
straining all its efforts to reassure the unsettled and
retain them in the fold.

The second great question to be answered was, Does
the Infallibility Dogma accord with History? Upon
this subject Roman writers were greatly divided. Some
asserted boldly that Papal Infallibility had always
been held in the Church. Manning stated this in its
extremest form. The doctrine had always been of
divine faith. Newman was quite unable to accept this
view, and supported Gladstone in rejecting it.

/#
"Newman," says Ambrose De Lisle, in a letter
to Gladstone, "considers your reply to Archbishop
Manning's contention that Papal Infallibility was
always held as a dogma of divine faith complete, and
that you are triumphant in your denial of it--but, he
adds, that is nothing to me. I conclude," says De
Lisle,[2] "because he deduces it, and holds that the
Church has deduced it in these latter days out of the
three texts he quotes in his letter to the Duke of
Norfolk."
#/

According to this view then of Newman, Papal Infallibility
was not to be sought in history. It would not

[Footnote 1: Letter to Duke of Norfolk, p. 17.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Life of De Lisle</i>, ii. p. 48.]
-----File: p287.png--------------------------------------------------------
be found in the age, for instance, of the Fathers--an
age which Newman knew profoundly. It has slowly
dawned upon the self-consciousness of the Church, and
come to be realised that it possessed this organ of
infallible utterance. Thus the necessity for squaring the
Vatican Decree with History was entirely dispensed with.
The principle of development was utilised to facilitate
its acceptance and explain the apparent anomalies.

The Pope said Newman is "heir by default" to the
ecumenical hierarchy of the fourth century. What
was then ascribed to all the Bishops is now ascribed
exclusively to him. Precisely so. But by what right?
Newman does not say. The possibility of development
in excess, a perverse development, is not discussed.

Thus the new Decree was, according to Newman,
if De Lisle rightly interprets him, a deduction from
three texts, of which the chief undoubtedly was, "I have
prayed for thee that thy faith fail not." No perpetual
unvarying tradition could be claimed for it. But the
Church makes inferences from Scripture, and comes to
realise, what once it did not realise, that the Roman
Pontiff is infallible.

Newman's theory of the relation of Papal Infallibility
to History greatly perplexed some whom it was designed
to help.

/#
"I confess that would not satisfy me," wrote De
Lisle....[1] I am far from going to all lengths with
the Archbishop (Manning) yet ... I hold ... that
Papal Infallibility restricted as it is by the Vatican
Definition, was always a part of Divine Revelation....
I maintain that it was always believed by
the orthodox...."
#/

Newman once wrote: "Whether the minute facts of
history will bear me out in this view I leave to others

[Footnote 1: <i>Life of De Lisle</i>, ii. p. 48.]
-----File: p288.png--------------------------------------------------------
to determine." This distressed a student of history
such as Lord Acton. "Döllinger," said Acton, "would
have feared to adopt a view for its own sake, without
knowing how it would be borne out by the minute facts
of history."[1]

There were able and learned members of the Roman
Communion to whom it was impossible to take refuge
in Newman's theory, that this was a case of legitimate
development. The Catholic consciousness of early ages
presented a theory out of which Papal Infallibility could
never legitimately grow. For the primitive conception
was the negative, they held, of such a view. The
primitive theory, as the Councils of the Church made
plain, placed the final authority in the Collective
Episcopate. The transference of this authority from
the entire body to one individual was to them no true
development at all, but a dislocation in the Church's
original constitution. It really meant requiring one
organ to discharge the functions of another; depriving
the original organ of what had hitherto constituted its
essential function. And this alteration or reversal of
functions was beyond the legitimate power of any
authority to make. It was indeed admitted to be a
claim of vital character. Pius IX. declared the doctrine
to be the very essence and basis of Catholicity. Strange,
men thought, that this essence and basis had remained
unrealised for many centuries in the Church's consciousness.
And when it was said, in reply, that practically
the Pope had exercised this Infallibility, and that its
exercise had met with a practical recognition and
acceptance, Roman writers answered at once, "No;
this is not true." Undoubtedly the papal discussions
have been accepted and believed. But hitherto there
has always been space for belief that their validity

[Footnote 1: <i>History of Freedom</i>, p. 408.]
-----File: p289.png--------------------------------------------------------
depended not on their own inherent weight, but on
the consent of the Church.

Professor Schulte, for instance, declared that though
a Catholic born and bred, he had never believed in
Papal Infallibility; nor could he find any authority
for the July Decree either in Scripture, or in the Fathers,
or in any other source of historical information.

Fessler endeavoured to crush this resistance by
labelling it private judgment. He says of Schulte that
he "refuses to accept the definition <i>de fide</i> of an Ecumenical
Council; he cares nothing for the authority of
the living teaching Church; only for what he thinks
he finds in Scripture, in the Fathers, and in other
genuine ancient sources. This is the way to forsake
the Catholic Church altogether. Every one is to follow
his own guidance, his own private judgment."[1]

Expressed in such a form it seems a <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i>. Surely the individual may be mistaken?
And in the multitude of counsellors there is wisdom.
Professor This on one side, the Episcopate on the other:
can we doubt which to follow? Why then should not
the professor make a sacrifice of his intellect? Because
if you destroy a man's confidence in his historic judgment
in one instance, you ruin its validity in all others. Now,
since it is by such a judgment that Christianity itself
is accepted, to bid a man disparage his own judgment
of history, is to undermine the very basis of his religion.

Men found themselves, therefore, placed by the
Decree in a very terrible dilemma. An ecumenical
decision must be true. But history appears to refute
it. To accept the decision is to contradict the fact of
history. To accept history is to reject authority. That
was the difficulty. But no man can without grievous
loss abandon what appears to him the truth. Others

[Footnote 1: Fessler, p. 24.]
-----File: p290.png--------------------------------------------------------
endeavour to reconcile Catholics to the new Decree
by extenuating the greatness of the change. Bishop
Ullathorne informed his people that "the Pope always
wielded this Infallibility, and all men knew this to be
the fact. What practical change, then, has the definition
made?"[1] Yet the same writer could urge[2] that
the character of the age, and the opposition within the
Church, "rendered it all the more important that the
Pope should be armed with that full strength." It
was then a great practical change. And this is what
many Romans felt. There was something naïve in
the simplicity with which Ullathorne wrote:[3] "The
Infallibility leaves all things as before, excepting that
now it is a term of communion." Leaves all things as
before! except that formerly men could disbelieve it
and openly deny it, while now it is a term of communion,
and to disbelieve is to be cast out. Ullathorne
clearly found it beyond his power to give any satisfaction
to the intelligence of his people. It amounted to
a demand of blind assent to the hitherto discredited.

It remains to trace the attitude of the minority toward
the new Decree. As a whole they give the impression
of having been crushed, almost stunned. The dreamlike
rapidity of the movements during these last six months;
the sudden forcible erection of a hitherto controvertible
and controverted opinion into an essential element of
the Eternal Faith; the consequent intellectual and
moral reversions demanded of them, left them in a
state of complete disorganisation and confusion. Their
collective inability in Rome to resist in the final Public
Session; their opinion that such resistance would be
incompatible with the respect due to the papal office,
form conclusive evidence beforehand of their inability

[Footnote 1: <i>Döllingerites</i>, p. 14.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Expostulation</i>, p. 50.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Döllingerites</i>, p. 15.]
-----File: p291.png--------------------------------------------------------
to continue a permanent resistance when isolated in
their different dioceses. The individual Bishop was a
lesser power than the Bishops assembled. He was
separated in his diocese from the support of like minded
prelates. And, if released from the immediate pressure
of papal influence, he was incapacitated for anything like
concerted action. As Bishop, he lived and spoke alone.
Communication was difficult owing to war. International
Meetings were impossible. Meanwhile the solitary
Bishop was beset by all the local influences which the
Nuncios, and Jesuits and other religious orders, knew so
thoroughly well how to wield. Rome, it has been said,
disbelieved in the capacity of the opposition to stand
firm; and Rome had calculated with profound insight
and accuracy.

Several fugitive Bishops took the precaution before
they left Rome of sending a letter of submission[1] to the
coming Decree.

The Archbishop of Cologne explained to the Pope
that having given a qualified vote on 13th July he
cannot conscientiously vote Yes on 18th July. Accordingly,
with great distress, and out of reverence for the
Pope, he will avail himself of the permission to depart:
adding that he submits himself to what the Council is
about to decree.

The Archbishop of Maintz wrote a similar apology.
To oppose, in the Public Session, was repugnant to his
feelings: nothing, therefore, remained but to depart;
except to add that he submitted himself to the Council's
Decree, just as if he had remained to vote approval.

Before submission to the new dogma, the question was
discussed, What constitutes promulgation of a Decree?
Such discussion was quite in keeping with precedent.
The Decrees of Trent had been discussed before they

[Footnote 1: <i>Acta</i>, p. 993.]
-----File: p292.png--------------------------------------------------------
were admitted into the Church of France. Was any collective
acceptance necessary, before the dogma could
become obligatory upon the consciences of the faithful?
True that Infallibility had been passed at Rome; but the
Vatican Council was not closed--it was only adjourned.
Did the decisions of a Council become obligations until
the Council itself had finished its work? Questions of
this character were argued at considerable length in the
hope of some loophole or relief. They were, however,
promptly crushed by a letter from the watchful Antonelli[1]
to the Brussel's Nuncio to the effect that the Decree was
<i>ipso facto</i> binding on the Catholic world, and needed no
further publication. This cut away the hope to which
some Bishops clung, that they would not be required to
take open action in cases where they knew acceptance
of the doctrine to be morally impossible.


I. AMONG THE FRENCH ROMANISTS

2. The Archbishop of Paris voted,[2] consistently with his
entire attitude, against the doctrine of Papal Infallibility,
on the critical day, 13th July. In the interview on
Saturday 16th, he prefaced his expostulations with a
promise to submit; but he also resolved to absent
himself from the Public Session, and wrote to the Pope
to say that he should not be present. On Sunday the
17th he saw the Pope again, and said farewell. No
allusion was made to the events of the morrow, or to the
Council's voting. Pius confined himself to benevolent
generalities, on the devotion of the Archbishop and
clergy of Paris to the interests of the Church and of the
Holy See.[3] The Pope and the Archbishop corresponded

[Footnote 1: 11th August. Ollivier, ii. p. 375; Schulte, p. 108.]

[Footnote 2: Acton, p. 997.]

[Footnote 3: Guillermin, p. 254.]
-----File: p293.png--------------------------------------------------------
subsequently; but they never met again. Darboy left
Rome when the Session was held, and returned home
to his diocese. There he found everything in confusion,
for the war against Prussia was declared. But he
assembled his clergy at once, and commended them for
refusing to be swayed by rumours which were necessarily
unreliable, since those who spoke about the Council
were not its members, while those who were its members
had not the right to speak.[1] If there had been
diversities of opinion in the Council on certain questions,
these diversities were concerned less with the intrinsic
value of the questions than with the losses or gains
which their discussion might involve. With these, and
similar generalities, he dismissed them. Further discussion
and conference was prevented by the Franco-Prussian
War, but it is clear that Darboy took no steps
whatever to coerce his priests into explicit confession
of the new decree or to enquire into their individual
convictions.

But it was evident that Rome was more than discontented
with the Archbishop's indifference. It was
desired that he should renew his assurances of personal
belief, and exhibit some interest in the conversion of the
reluctant. In February 1871 Bishop Maret wrote to
the Archbishop of Paris[2] to say that he had sent
in his own submission in the previous November.

/#
"I am glad to hear it," replied the Archbishop. "As for
myself, separated from the world for five months by
the siege of Paris, I have been unable to ascertain what
was happening, or to correspond with my colleagues or
with Rome. I have therefore done nothing; although
I have given no one the right to doubt my opinions.
Indeed the Pope knows them. He has my letter of
#/

[Footnote 1: Foulon, p. 469; Guillermin, p. 257.]

[Footnote 2: Guillermin, p. 259.]
-----File: p294.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
18th July. It was not so much the basis of the Decree
as the question of its opportuneness which made us
hesitate. All the world knows this; and, for my own
part, I said it in full Council. It seems, therefore, to me
superfluous to affirm to-day that I accept the Decree[**P2: missing .] It
would be even misleading; for it would give grounds
to the suggestion that I withheld my adherence to the
present time--which is false. Still, if the Holy Father
wishes, for the sake of people in general, that such a
declaration should be made, it is a formality to which
I will unhesitatingly yield."[1]
#/

The Archbishop found it prudent to take this course.
In March 1871, he sent to the Pope a statement of
sincere assent to the Decree.[2] He said that the War
had prevented correspondence hitherto, and that his
declaration might seem superfluous. But, as he hears
that the Pope desires it, he hastens to gratify the wish.
It was chiefly the question of opportuneness--he does
not say entirely--which had prompted his opposition.

Pius IX. replied--but none too effusively. The Archbishop
had been for years mistrusted and disliked in
Rome, for the independence of his actions, his determination
to govern his diocese himself, and his rejection
of ultramontane convictions. It was scarcely to be
expected that cordiality could exist in the very
moment of his defeat. And his submission even now,
was to say the least, somewhat curt. It stated the
fact: no less, but no more. It is not the letter a man
could write who believed himself to be the privileged
recipient of a precious revelation of God's truth. It was
the bare submission to a dictate which could not be
avoided except by expulsion. The Pope replied that he
was consoled by the Archbishop's sincere assent to the
dogmatic definition of the Ecumenical Council of the

[Footnote 1: Guillermin, p. 259.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Acta</i>, p. 997.]
-----File: p295.png--------------------------------------------------------
Vatican. He trusts that the Archbishop will hasten to
propound to his people what he professes himself to
believe. With this, the Pope sends his apostolic benediction.
Newman once accused Pusey of discharging
an olive branch from a catapult; Pius IX. seems here
to illustrate the art of conveying a rebuke through
the instrumentality of a blessing. It is one of the
ironies of this story that the letter was never received.[1]
These were the days of the Commune. The brave
Archbishop, after exhibiting the most striking fortitude,
was shot in prison. He never had the opportunity to
read, or act upon, the Pope's advice. To his place, but
not to his principles, succeeded Archbishop Guibert,
who had so greatly assisted the aims of Pius IX. by
recommending, in the Select Committee of Proposals,
that the new doctrine should be introduced with the
Council's deliberations. So the old order changed.

2. Dupanloup,[2] Bishop of Orleans, voted against the
doctrine on the 13th of July, and left for his diocese
rather than be present at the Public Session when the
dogma was decreed. He wrote a letter of submission
on 18th February 1871. He says that he has been
prevented from writing by the Franco-Prussian War.
Hearing that His Holiness desires to know his attitude
to the constitution of 18th July, he wishes to say that
he has no difficulty in the matter.

/#
"I only wrote and spoke," he says, "against the
opportuneness of the definition. As to the doctrine
I always held it not only in my heart, but in public
writings.... I have no difficulty in again declaring
my adhesion; only too happy if I can thereby offer
Your Holiness any comfort in the midst of his heavy
trials."
#/

[Footnote 1: Foulon, p. 505.]

[Footnote 2: Acton, p. 999.]
-----File: p296.png--------------------------------------------------------

Since his return from Rome he has written to his
diocese that the conflicts of the Church are not like
those of the world.

These assertions of Dupanloup as to his unvarying
faith may possibly explain why a distinguished fellow-countryman
and head of the French Government[1]
could describe him in such terms as these: "everything
about him indicates the irresistible dominion of impressions.
So convinced is he of being in the right that
he fails to be accurate to his demonstrations. He is
a most imperious advocate of liberty, and always under
the influence of preconceptions."

3. Gratry may be taken next: Gratry--whose famous
four letters had focussed[P2**focused] in brilliant light the difficulties,
the contradictions, the adverse facts, the ignorant
methods, the falsified documents. Men wondered what
steps the former priest of the Oratory would now take;
now that the thing that he feared had come to pass,
and the incredible was decreed. Gratry had endured
much mental agony. "His own peace would certainly
have been better insured," says his biographer,[2] "had
he not been interrupted in that later contemplative
study of Christian philosophy by which he hoped to
do somewhat to make his fellowmen less unhappy, less
unfit. But he was urged as a matter of conscience to
enter the turmoil of polemical strife, a strife more cruel to
one who retained his childlike simplicity, his love of
truth, and his boundless charity, to the last hour of life."

Gratry was very ill of the malady which killed him;
and it was not until November 1871, that he wrote[3]
(evidently questioned by Guibert, the new Archbishop of
Paris):

[Footnote 1: Ollivier, i. p. 443.]

[Footnote 2: Adolphe Perraud, <i>Le P. Gratry ses Derniers jours, son Testament
Spirituel</i> (1872), p. 43.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Acta</i>, p. 1405.]
-----File: p297.png--------------------------------------------------------

/#
"Had I not been very ill and unable to write a
letter I should have long since sent you my congratulations.
I desire at least to-day, my lord,
to say simply what it appears to me there was no
necessity to say, namely that, like all my brethren in
the priesthood, I accept the decrees of the Vatican
Council. I cancel everything contrary to the decrees
which I may have written on this subject before the
decision."[1]
#/

The Archbishop sent a kindly reply to the effect
that he had never doubted Gratry's docility.

/#
"By such noble and generous examples we harmonise
our conduct with our convictions, and prove to the
world that we are sincere in maintaining that the light
of faith is superior to that of our feeble and vacillating
reason."
#/

But how about the facts of history? Gratry effaced
his interpretation; but he could not cancel the facts.
How abandon his former convictions? That is precisely
what Gratry's colleagues required him to explain. An
explanation, therefore, he attempted to give. To those
who reproved him for accepting without reservation the
Council's decrees, he explains that, before the Decision,
he argued in accordance with his conscience and his
right; since the Decision, he had not said a word.

/#
"Since the Decision, and immediately after it, I had
two interviews with my Archbishop, Mgr. Darboy.[2]
We were agreed both in words and in faith. He granted
me my position in the Church of Paris, and my office
of Professor of Theology at the Sorbonne. I was therefore
at unity with my Bishop. That was obvious. It
continued for nearly a year. Therefore, strictly speaking,
no one has any right to question me; not even
#/

[Footnote 1: <i>Acta</i>, p. 1405.]

[Footnote 2: Guillermin, <i>Vie.[** '.'  needed?] de Mgr. Darboy</i>, p. 261.]
-----File: p298.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
Mgr. Darboy's successor. To require of me a public
declaration would seem like revising the acts of his
glorious predecessor and martyr for the faith. It is
for this last reason most of all that those among my
friends who urged me most to publish some declaration
surprised and saddened me. I have constantly
answered them that I have nothing to say, and nothing
to write upon this subject."
#/

But, on reflecting that there was no necessity to cling
tenaciously to strict rights, if an assurance would remove
his brethren's anxiety, Gratry wrote to his new Archbishop
a letter of submission. That, he says, was easy.
What would not have been easy was to say:--

/#
"I have been a member and a soldier of the Catholic
Church for half a century, but now comes an Ecumenical
Council which I do not acknowledge. I therefore
separate from its Communion. To contradict, at a
single stroke, all my life, and deny all my deepest
convictions--do you blame me for not doing that?"
#/

If they object that this was not an Ecumenical Council
since it was not free, Gratry replies that he is unable
to deny its validity, and therefore he must submit to
its decisions. Then, Gratry asks himself, what the
great historic luminaries of the Church of France,
Fénelon and Bossuet, would have done under the
circumstances. Had Montalembert survived, he would
certainly have submitted, as his own words prove:
resolved, come what may, and cost what it may, never
to transgress the inviolable limits of unity. But what
of Gratry's letters? Strongly worded remonstrances
had reached him on this. How could he cancel his
letters and their unanswerable demonstrations? how
contradict himself? how overthrow truths which he has
firmly established, and re-establish the falsehoods which
he has overthrown? To this difficult enquiry Gratry's
answer was:--
-----File: p299.png--------------------------------------------------------

/#
"I mean to overthrow none of the truths which I
may have established in these letters. I mean to restore
no falsehood therein denounced. But I admit that
these letters may contain mistakes; and that it is those
mistakes which I mean to efface."
#/

A distinguished Bishop, strongly opposed to the contents
of the letters, had been advising him that he could
maintain a considerable portion of his letters. All that
was necessary was to cancel what contradicted the Decree.

Is it too much to say that this explanation is shorn
of all the reasoning force and historic cogency of the
famous letters? If words have any meaning, Gratry's
entire conception of Honorius, and the attitude of the
Councils towards him, left no room for the Vatican
Dogma. The explanation reveals nothing so plainly
as profound intellectual perplexity.

Gratry also wrote an explanatory letter to M. Legouvé,
a colleague in the French Academy.

/#
"I opposed inspired Infallibility; the Council's decree
has rejected inspired Infallibility. I opposed personal
Infallibility; the Decree affirms official Infallibility.
Some writers of the School which I consider exaggerated
did not wish for Infallibility <i>ex cathedra</i>, which seemed
to them too narrow a restriction: the Decree affirms
Infallibility <i>ex cathedra</i>. I almost feared a scientific
Infallibility, a political and governmental Infallibility:
but the Decree only affirms doctrinal Infallibility, in
matters of faith and morals.

"All this does not mean that I made no mistakes
in my opposition. Doubtless I have made mistakes,
both on this subject and on others; but as soon as
I recognise my error I cancel it, without feeling
thereby humiliated."
#/

This letter was not printed until 1907. And it
appears that Gratry wrote still further explanations
-----File: p300.png--------------------------------------------------------
which have not been published yet. A recently printed
letter of Charles Perraud contains the following important
postscript:--

/#
"Father Gratry bids me say that he has just finished
a little work in which he explains his reasons and
above all the limits of his submission to the Council's
decree. He had already given a summary of these
explanations in a letter to M. Legouvé (who unhappily
will not agree to publish it, I cannot imagine why).
I was not with Father Gratry when he sent his letter
to the Archbishop of Paris. I regret exceedingly
that he began with that, whereas he ought to have
begun by publishing the writing which I have recently
been reading. It contains definitions and distinctions
of very great significance, especially in a matter where
every shade of meaning has its distinctive worth. They
are altogether mistaken who suppose that Father Gratry
has treated with contempt the historic evidence. God
give him time to say on this matter all that I know
he desires to say."
#/

But this document, without which the complete story
of Gratry's submission cannot be told, has never been
permitted to see the light. For whatever reason,
Adolphe Perraud, Gratry's literary executor and
biographer, withheld it from history.

But Gratry did not long survive the passing of the new
Decree. "And," says his biographer, "most assuredly
the trials of this period shortened his days."[1]


II. AMONG ENGLISH SPEAKING ROMANISTS

Archbishop Kenrick of St Louis represented opposition
in the American Church. During the Council
he had warmly supported Dupanloup against American
Ultramontanes.

"Many among us," he wrote,[1] "believe that Ecclesiastical
history, the history of the Popes, the history
of the Councils, and the Tradition of the Church, are
not in harmony with the new doctrine. Therefore we
think it most inopportune to define as a dogma of
faith an opinion which seems to us a novelty in the
Church, destitute of solid foundation in Scripture and
Tradition, and contradicted by indisputable evidence."

circulated, he was more emphatic still.

"I dare to affirm that the opinion as expressed in
the Schema is not a doctrine of the faith, and never
can become such by any definition even of a Council."

On the 13th of July Archbishop Kenrick voted in
the negative, signed the protest of the 17th, and with
the body of the opposition fled away. Having thus
registered his informal and useless protest he accepted
the new Decree. This surrender provoked a letter from
Lord Acton asking the Archbishop for the grounds
of his submission. History has preserved the pages of
Kenrick's reply.[3] He said that "sufficient time seems
to have elapsed to allow the Catholic world to
decide whether or not the decree of the Council was
to be accepted." The greater number of the Bishops,
some to the Archbishop's surprise, had already yielded
assent. As for himself--

/#
"I could not defend the Council or its action; but
I always professed that the acceptance of either by
the Church would supply its deficiency. I accordingly
made up my mind to submit to what appeared
inevitable, unless I were prepared to separate myself

/#
at least in the judgment of most Catholics from the
Church."
#/

His act of submission "was one of pure obedience,
and was not grounded on the removal of my motives
of opposition to the decrees, as referred to in my
speech, and set forth in my pamphlets." He hears
from Rome that the Pope requires him to retract his
pamphlets. "This I shall not do, no matter what the
consequences may be."

For intellectual justification in this submission Kenrick
appealed to Newman's theory of Development. If it
justified Newman in becoming a Catholic, "I thought
that it might justify me in remaining one." To this the
Archbishop added the following memorable sentence:--

/#
"Notwithstanding my submission, I shall never teach
the doctrine of Papal Infallibility so as to <i>argue</i> from
Scripture or Tradition in its support, and shall leave
to others to explain its compatibility with the facts
of Ecclesiastical history to which I referred in my reply.
As long as I may be permitted to remain in my present
station I shall confine myself to administrative functions,
which I can do the more easily without attracting
attention, as for some few years past I have seldom
preached."
#/

His whole experience, he says, has taught him that
there can be no liberty in any future sessions of the
Council; and this is warning enough to Bishops that
they must not handle roughly the delicate matters on
which they have to decide.

The records of intellectual servitude present few more
painful documents than this. Whether one regards the
doctrine, the Archbishop, or the facts of history, such
an attitude bristles with intellectual if not moral inconsistencies.
He thinks acceptance by the Church will
-----File: p303.png--------------------------------------------------------
redeem the doctrine from conciliar defects: but the
essence of the doctrine is Infallibility apart from the
Church's consent. As Bishop he is a witness to the
Faith: yet he observes in silence, and registers one by
one the submission of other Bishops. He accepts what
he will not proclaim, and cannot defend. Meanwhile,
the facts of history continue, as before, demonstrably
irreconcilable with the New Decree. The sole virtue
by which everything else is supposed to be redeemed
is the virtue of submission. Theories such as this can
only exist as a dark background to enhance the moral
and spiritual superiority of sincere unbelief and genuine
schism; or to warn for ever against the disastrous
consequences which follow such exercises of authority
as that which produced the Vatican Decree.


III. AN ITALIAN INSTANCE

<i>Cardinal Hohenlohe</i>

The "Memoirs" of Prince Hohenlohe include numerous
confidential letters from his brother, Cardinal Hohenlohe,
who was resident in Rome during the Council of the
Vatican. The Cardinal had no sympathy whatever
with the attempt to elevate the theory into a dogma
of the Faith.

His repugnance to the proceedings at the Vatican
took also a practical shape. "I go as little as possible
to the Meetings of the Council," he wrote; adding
a private wish that the Jesuits might stick fast in the
morass of their operations. Their activities, however,
increased. On the eve of the great Decision, Cardinal
Hohenlohe wrote the following remarkable words:--
-----File: p304.png--------------------------------------------------------

/#
"To-day is to take place the sitting in which the
Pope will proclaim the doctrine of Infallibility. The
Bishops of the minority are leaving; some of them
went yesterday evening, among others the Archbishop
of Munich; others go away to-night. They will not
be present at the sitting, and have sent in a protest.
I am not very well, and I, too, am not going to the
sitting. This morning I wrote a few lines to Cardinal
Schwarzenberg, which I here transcribe, of course in
the strictest confidence, because they make clear my
sentiments.... 'If on the question of Infallibility I
declare myself entirely in agreement with Cardoni[1] I
would yet have voted <i>non placet</i>, since the question
is not opportune, and was not treated <i>conciliariter</i>,
and I will have neither part nor lot in the guilt of this
unhappy measure, which has caused so many souls to
stumble in the faith. But further, the Council is no
longer a Council. We may admit that it was convened
<i>legaliter</i>, but from the moment when the <i>methodus</i> was
imposed upon us, the <i>conciliar</i> composition of this unhappy
assembly was at an end.'

"So much for my letter to Cardinal Schwarzenberg.
It is sad enough that one has to speak so, but I am
pierced in the innermost depths of my soul with such
intense pain, that I could hardly bear it if I had not
the consolation of the Holy Mass."
#/

Cardinal Hohenlohe says that he had been taught
to believe that papal decisions <i>ex cathedra</i> were infallible.
What is clear is that the Council contributed nothing
to a belief which he held as a theological opinion, and
not as a dogma of faith. A letter from the Pope's
private secretary expressed regret at his absence from
the Decision on 18th July. Hohenlohe replied that he
had always believed in Infallibility.

Quoting this reply, in a letter to his brother, the
Cardinal added, confidentially:--

[Footnote 1: An advocate of the infallibilist theory.]
-----File: p305.png--------------------------------------------------------

/#
"There is nothing here about the Council and
dogmatic constitution, nor did I even write that to
the Pope, but only to Mgr. Cenni (the private secretary),
without in the least instructing him to communicate
it to his Holiness. So long as I am unconvinced of
the validity of the Council, so long can I do no more,
since I shall yet have to give an account before God,
and I would not get into an unpleasant situation there."
#/

Prince Hohenlohe was not less discouraged than the
Cardinal. What particularly grieved him was the lack
of moral courage in the German Bishops. To others
and to himself it seemed a

/#
"disgraceful apostasy of the German Bishops, seeing that
after they had pledged themselves, before their departure
from Rome, to decide nothing about the Dogma of
Infallibility without previously taking council together,
they should nevertheless have submitted individually.

"When one views the moral ruin, the complete lack
of honour among the Bishops, one shudders at the
influence which the Jesuitical element in the Church
can exert on human nature."
#/

It is natural to enquire what overt action the
advocates of these views and its sympathisers in the
Roman body would adopt. The excommunication of
Döllinger roused still further feeling; and an important
meeting of political opponents of things ultramontane
was held in Berlin. There was among them a strong
desire for action of some kind, and for emphatic opposition.
But Prince Hohenlohe disapproved.

/#
"I demonstrated," he says, "that it was necessary above
all things for us to remain in the Catholic Church. So
long as we had no Bishops, no clergy, and no congregations,
but only a number of cultured laymen, we could
not talk of an old Catholic Church. It was a case of
waiting till the Pope should die, and then there was
#/
-----File: p306.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
hope of a better spirit in the Catholic Church. If we
left the Church--and this might be the result of any
serious step--the Catholic Church would lose so many
reasonable men to no purpose." It was therefore
decided to remain quiet. "I do not think," Prince
Hohenlohe wrote, "that the agitation will produce any
great results. Interest in the person and fate of
Döllinger, for it is nothing more, does not make a
reformation. Interest in dogmatic subtleties no longer
exists."
#/

The Prince recorded his personal convictions in the
following memorandum:--

/#
"I am of opinion that the Concilium Vaticanum of
1869-1870 is in no way ecumenical, and that the time
will come when the Infallibility of the Pope proclaimed
therein will be pronounced heresy. But as the Bishops
collectively and almost all the clergy have accepted
the doctrine set forth, he who denies the doctrine must
secede from the Catholic Church.... I have, therefore,
refrained from expressing my opinion openly,
especially as I believe that the Old Catholic Community
cannot remain where it now stands, but will be driven
further.... So far as I am concerned, I wish the
Catholic Church to reform herself. That can and will be
done only with the co-operation of her Bishops. This
co-operation will not take place until the moment has
come for the assembling of a really Ecumenical Council.
Even if this is an empty hope, it in no case alters
my present opinion. In this case the Catholic Church
is doomed to fall, and then other forms of religion will
be constituted, which we need not now discuss. In the
meantime I have this hope, and therefore am waiting.
Hence I remain a member of the Church, without going
over to the Ultramontanes."
#/


IV. IN GERMANY

1. Hefele, Bishop of Rottenburg, formerly Professor of
Theology in the University of Tübingen, and learned,
-----File: p307.png--------------------------------------------------------
perhaps above any man then living, in the Councils
of the Church, was held in high reputation for his
history of the Councils, which is still the best modern
authority on the subject. He was well known as the
reverse of ultramontane. Twelve years before the
Vatican Council assembled he stated the facts about
Pope Honorius in such a manner as to show that history
absolutely forbade the ascription to a Pope of the
attribute of Infallibility.

Being consecrated Bishop at the end of 1869 he had
a place in the Vatican Assembly, where he was most
active in opposition. Just in the critical hour of the
Infallibility debate he published (in April, 1870) at
Naples, since Papal regulations prevented its publication
in Rome, a forcible pamphlet on the case of Pope
Honorius, and his treatment by the Sixth General
Council. Hefele now declared that Honorius "set
aside the distinctively orthodox technical term for the
two wills, human and Divine, in Christ; sanctioned the
distinctively technical term of the Monothelite heresy;
and commended this double error to the acceptance
of the faithful." Further, he maintained that the sixth
Ecumenical Council had claimed the right to pass
judgment on this authoritative Papal decision, and to
pass anathema upon the Pope as a teacher of heresy.
Finally, he maintained that from the fifth to the eleventh
century each Pope in his consecration oath had made a
declaration which involved two things: first, that a
Council can condemn a Pope for heresy, and secondly,
that Honorius was rightly so condemned for having
supported an error by his decree on faith.

This emphatic rejection of Infallibility was circulated
among the members of the Council in Rome, with
intention to prevent the doctrine from being decreed.

Hefele also wrote from Rome to Döllinger, com-*
-----File: p308.png--------------------------------------------------------
*plaining that the majority interfered with the minority's
freedom of speech; that the Pope's personal interventions
and criticisms on the minority made their
independent action exceedingly difficult; that these
experiences were diminishing the courage, if not the
numbers, of the opposition; that it was difficult to know
what movement to take when a halter was round your
neck; that hardly anybody dared openly to say what
their ultimate intentions were; that the majority meanwhile
confidently assured them that the Pope would
settle everything, and that then the alternative would
be submission or excommunication.

On the 13th of July Hefele voted in the negative.
On the 17th he signed the protest and then returned to
his diocese without waiting for the Public Session. In
a letter to Döllinger he attempted to justify this. He
said that from the number of negative votes on the 13th
of July he had hoped that many Bishops would remain
for a final protest in the Public Session of the 18th.
But in the general exodus this hope evaporated. He
acknowledged that the written protest sent to the Pope
was weak, because destitute of formal validity. It could
not possibly avert the public definition of the Decree.
As for himself he feels that his duty is clear. He
has been in consultation with his Chapter and his
Theological Faculty. He cannot accept the new dogma,
as it stands, without the necessary limitations. He
knows that Rome may suspend him, and excommunicate
him. Meantime he has been urging upon another
Bishop that disbelief in the Council's validity is not
heretical. His own line consists in quiescence, so long
as Rome does not actively intervene. What else to do
he does not know in the least. At any rate to hold as
Divinely revealed what is not true is for him simply
impossible (September 1870). He can no more conceal
-----File: p309.png--------------------------------------------------------
from himself in Rottenburg, than he could in Rome,
that the new dogma is destitute of any true rational,
Scriptural, or traditional foundations. It is injurious to
the Church in incalculable ways. The Church has
suffered no severer and deadlier wound of modern times
than that inflicted on the 18th of July. Yet he can see
no way of escape. He writes repeatedly to Döllinger;
complains that Dupanloup persists in asking questions,
but will not say what he intends to do. Meanwhile,
Hefele is being worried and baited on every side.
Appeals pour in from France and America, urging submission.
He is certain that a schism would have no
chance. The world is too indifferent, and the opposition
too dispersed. There is nothing for it but submission,
or exclusion. On the other hand, it is to him indisputably
clear that the final session of the Vatican
Council had no ecumenical character. Romanism and
Jesuitism have altered the nature of the Catholic
Church. Hefele's letters become still more piteous.
His troubles are increasing. His own diocese is turning
against him. He had not believed it possible that the
dogma could so pervade his diocese. Even his oldest
friends are turning against him. Rome also is improving
the occasion. He is refused the usual faculties, so
that people in all parts of the diocese cannot get
married, and the local clergy are utilising this to set
the people against him. What on earth is he to do?
He gives way to lamentations. The position of a
deprived and excommunicated Bishop is to him
abhorrent--one he could hardly tolerate. At an earlier
stage it was open to him to resign, and gladly would he
lay down an office which has made him such an
oppressed and unhappy man. He must resign or
yield.

Which of the two it will ultimately be it is not by
-----File: p310.png--------------------------------------------------------
this time difficult to predict. Hefele can see no glimmer
of hope in any distant development. It is not to be
expected that the Constitution Pastor Eternus will be
revoked by a future Pope, or the fourth session of the
Vatican Council pronounced invalid. The utmost that
can be looked for is a further explanation. By this time
he is the only German Bishop who has not published
the Constitution. He cannot adequately express his
grief that Döllinger should see no escape from suspension
or excommunication. Is there no compromise
with the Archbishop possible? He utters wild and
useless laments over the Synod of German Bishops at
Fulda. Oh, what might not have been done in Germany
if only the Bishops at Fulda had stood firm! Yet
he took no steps against them. Then he ends with
deploring Döllinger's own impending fate. To think
that Döllinger, so long the champion of the Catholic
Church and its interests, the first of the German theologians,
should be suspended or excommunicated; and
that by an Archbishop who has not done a thousandth
part of the service that Döllinger had done! That
is terrible! The conclusion was now quite plain.
Döllinger's replies were useless, and Hefele proceeded
to publish the Vatican Decree.

It remained, and this was more difficult, to revise the
case of Honorius in the light of the new dogma. In
the second edition of his "History of the Councils,"
Hefele observes:

/#
"We always were of the opinion that Honorius was
quite orthodox in thought, but, especially in his first
letter, he has unhappily expressed himself in a Monothelite
fashion." This opinion he still retained, "even
if ... as a result of repeated new investigation of this
subject, and having regard to what others have more
recently written in defence of Pope Honorius, I now
#/
-----File: p311.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
modify or abandon many details of my earlier statements,
or in particular, form a milder judgment of the
first letter of Honorius."
#/

Still, even now, his historic sense constrains him to
speak of the "the unhappy sentence, 'accordingly we
acknowledge one will of our Lord Jesus Christ,' which
taken literally is quite Monothelite." Still he is constrained
to say, "Honorius ought to have answered."
And as for the Monothelites themselves, "the fact that
the Pope gave utterance to this their primary proposition
must have given essential assistance to their cause."

2. Melchers, Archbishop of Cologne, professed himself
in the Council ready to accept the dogma as a
personal belief; but he accumulated many arguments
to show the extreme unwisdom of enforcing it upon
the Church, especially in the existing state of sharply-divided
opinion. On the critical 13th of July he gave a
conditional vote. His own subsequent compliance was,
therefore, comparatively easy. It was entirely another
matter to restore unity to his diocese.[1] Back in his
diocese he called the German Bishops together at
Fulda. Only nine arrived, but they agreed to take
measures to impose the doctrine upon the recalcitrant.
It became the Archbishop's function to reduce to
submission the Theological Faculty of Bonn, among
others the distinguished professors, Langen and Reusch.

3. The interview between the Archbishop of Cologne
and Professor Reusch has been recorded.

The Archbishop told the Professor that the highest
authority had spoken, and submission was his duty.
The Professor replied that his convictions would not
allow it. The Archbishop retorted that he laid too
much stress on his convictions. Reusch replied that he

[Footnote 1: See pp. 241, 242.]
-----File: p312.png--------------------------------------------------------
dared not go against them. The Archbishop restated
the duty of submission to authority; the Professor said
that he could only leave his convictions to the judgment
of God.

But, persisted the Archbishop, the Council was free
and ecumenical, and the definition unquestionably valid.
He acknowledged that he had himself implored the
Pope not to allow the discussion to begin; but the
majority thought otherwise. And, added the Archbishop,
with a happy inspiration, you know that the
doctrine has been recently taught in the Catechism of
this diocese. Until now, replied Reusch, the opposite
doctrine has been taught in all the schools, in a book
bearing the episcopal <i>imprimatur</i>. The Archbishop
could only reply that the book would be altered now,
and that its author had already conformed. But,
objected the Professor, if the opposite has been taught
up to the 18th of last July, it cannot be a heresy.

The Archbishop could only enquire whether the
Professor would make any concession of any kind. He
said he would avoid contradiction, and study further.
The Archbishop pointed out that Rome would never
be satisfied with that. Do you wish, he asked, to die
without the Sacraments? The interview was adjourned,
and then resumed, but fruitlessly. The Archbishop
recommended him to go into retreat. The Professor
doubted whether this could alter facts of history. His
reward was excommunication.

Reusch's reflections on the interview with his Archbishop
show what resistance cost him. "How painful it
was, he wrote, although I continued calm and the Archbishop
always friendly, you can well imagine. But I
formed a gloomier opinion of his narrow-mindedness
than ever before." Melcher's insistence on the duty of
unlimited intellectual submission left, so far as Reusch
-----File: p313.png--------------------------------------------------------
could see, no room for reason. It provoked the criticism
that the Archbishop would credit four Persons to the
Trinity if a papal constitution demanded it. But for
himself, Reusch wrote in terms almost of despair. That
he might no longer pursue his mission as a teacher was
hard enough. That he might no more discharge his
priestly functions, nor obtain absolution and communion
was terrible. But yet he would be more unhappy still
if these had been obtained at the price of assenting to
the dogma. And Reusch uttered his grief in the words
of Ecclesiastes:--

/#
"Wherefore I praised the dead which are already
dead more than the living which are yet alive. Yea,
better is he than both they, which hath not yet been,
who hath not seen the evil work that is done under
the sun."
#/

There remained, however, a work for Reusch to do.
He found within the old Catholic communion a freedom
to retain unaltered the faith which, up to that year, he
had taught within the communion of Rome.

4. The fate of Langen, Theological Professor of
Bonn, was somewhat similar to that of Reusch. When
asked for his assent to the new Decree, Langen contended
that the University statutes secured him his
office conditionally on assent to the decisions of Trent;
and that no alteration of these conditions could be
made without approval of the Government. The Archbishop
overruled this contention, and Langen declined
to submit. Like Reusch, he was excommunicated.
Langen has left behind him a history of the Roman
See, and an extremely learned and exhaustive history
of interpretation of the Scripture-texts usually adduced
in behalf of the papal claims. Both these works display
that Langen could not accept the new definition without
falsifying the facts of history.
-----File: p314.png--------------------------------------------------------

5. Another German rejection of the doctrine is that of
Dr Hasenclever.[1]

/#
"With countless other companions in faith I find
myself reduced by the Papal Decree of 18th July 1870
to the alternative of either denying against my
conscience the ancient faith as I received it, and on
the basis of which I have remained for five and twenty
years in the Catholic Church, or of placing myself in
hopeless antagonism to a justly revered authority
through refusal to submit."
#/

Undoubtedly the principle is true that when the
Church has once spoken all uncertainty is taken away;
but no less undoubted is the principle that where a
contradiction exists, a manifest deviation from tradition,
it is impossible that it is the Church which has spoken.
It is impossible, he says, for him to bring into harmony
the new teaching on the Pope's Infallibility with the
Catholic Faith taught him by the Tridentine and Roman
Catechism.

The constitution of the Church, he argued, differs
from that of a State, for while the latter may assume
at various periods a democratic, an aristocratic, a
monarchical form--the former must maintain its self-identity.
This principle of identity and continuity is,
he acknowledges, recognised in the Anglican Church
which, while uncertain of the validity of its claims, he
admits, is thereby distinguished from the Protestant
types. But his sympathies are with the principle that
the constitution of the Church cannot change its form.
He is as opposed to a spiritual dictatorship as to
Protestantism itself. Is it possible that the conception
of supreme authority in the Church which has held
good for eighteen hundred years, is no longer decisive?
So men enquired in amazement when the news of the

[Footnote 1: 1872.]
-----File: p315.png--------------------------------------------------------
schemes of the Roman Curia began to circulate. That
some reforms should be necessary was natural enough;
but that a radical change must be made in the constitution
of the supreme teaching body--this was incredible
even to many of the blindest followers of the Curia.
The Church has never exhibited a trace of uncertainty
on the method of securing finality in a question of faith.
It has been through the Collective Episcopate united with
its chief. In the Collective Episcopate as representative
of Christendom at large, the Church has acknowledged
the apostolic teaching office, the witness to its faith, the
judge of error. The mission of a Universal Council is
to give collective testimony to the faith of the Fathers.
This collective testimony might be voiced through the
Holy See, but it is impossible to discover in Revelation
a basis for the theory that the collective testimony is
not valid until the Holy See endorses it. The ancient
principle is to rest in the testimony of all churches:--

/#
"Ecumenical Councils," says Alzog, speaking of the
early centuries, "the real representatives of the Catholic
spirit, were in these ages of burning controversy the
decisive authority, the supreme tribunal which ended
all dogmatic disputes. And," adds Hasenclever, "it
was exactly when this principle became challenged by
another that the risk of schism appeared."
#/

Moreover, a mathematical formula may illustrate the
effect of the papal claim on the Episcopate. If <i>a</i>+<i>b</i>=<i>a</i>
then <i>b</i>=<i>o</i>[**0]; or, at any rate, is a practically negligible
quantity.

Hasenclever complains that he can nowhere obtain a
direct reponse[** response] to the question, How is it that innumerable
treatises and works of all kinds approved by the
Church have hitherto affirmed that Papal Infallibility is
no part of the Catholic Faith? What particularly
-----File: p316.png--------------------------------------------------------
scandalised him was the sudden condemnation, by
placing on the Index, books which have been for a
considerable period accepted authorities within the
Church. He failed to see that to bestow sanction
publicly upon a treatise, and afterwards to pronounce it
heretical, was consistent with the maintenance of an
unchanged faith. Moreover, if Papal Infallibility had
been the traditional principle, the entire history of the
Church must have presented a very different apearance [P2**appearance]
from what it does. Where, he asks, is any faith in
an infallible Pope exhibited in the Church during the
Arian struggles? Certainly the Bishops of the Sixth
Ecumenical Council conducted matters on somewhat
different lines from those suggested to us by infallibilists
to-day. They treated the Pope Honorius just
as they would have treated any other heretic. And
his successors did the same. The infallibilist falls
into Scylla if he escapes Charybdis. When entreated
to make a sacrifice of his intellect to this demand of
the Vatican Decree, Hasenclever can only reply that
such sacrifice paralyses the innermost depths of personal
existence. To him it is nothing less than a suicidal
suppression of that characteristic which raises us into
resemblance to God. Those who cannot bring themselves
to this abandonment of their human dignity
will be constrained to say, in spite of all the seductions
of superficial and sophistic reasonings, that the doctrine
of the personal infallibility of the Pope stands in irreconcilable
contradiction with the actual faith of the
Catholic Church; and, accordingly, it is impossible that
a real Ecumenical Council should have decreed it.

6. But these were minor incidents. The religious attention
of Germany centred on Döllinger at Munich. On
17th July Archbishop Scherr of Munich left Rome with
the minority. On the 18th the new dogma was pro-*
-----File: p317.png--------------------------------------------------------
claimed. On the 19th Archbishop Scherr was back in
Munich again. On the 21st the Theological Faculty,
headed by Döllinger, met him. Scherr's criticisms
of the Roman precedure[**procedure?], says Döllinger's German
biographer, Friedrich, confirmed them in the views of
the Council which they had already taken. But, said
Scherr, Rome has spoken. There was nothing for it
but submission. The Theological Faculty were totally
unprepared for the Archbishop's surrender. Upon
Döllinger it created the most painful impression. He
knew that the Archbishop's convictions, better judgments,
sympathies, were all on the other side; and that, like
the other Bishops of the minority, he had abandoned
the Council because he could neither bring himself
to acquiesce silently in the proclamation of what he
deprecated, nor summon courage to protest for what
he had hitherto believed. The feebleness of the Archbishop's
excuses, the frank condemnation pronounced by
him on the methods by which the result had been
secured, only set in stronger light the incongruity of his
submission. Naturally they served to confirm Döllinger
still more in his opinion of the absence of real freedom
in the Council Chamber at St Peter's.

Dr Liddon, who was in Munich on 29th July, gave
the following account of Döllinger some ten days after
the passing of the Decree:--

/#
"A large amount of our conversation, of course,
turned on the Council and the Definition; and he
speaks with the most entire unreserve. He says that
the great danger now is lest the Bishops of the minority,
being separated from each other, and exposed to the
powerful influences which can be brought to bear on
them, should gradually acquiesce. Nothing would be
worse for the cause of the Church in Germany than
the spectacle of such submission to a purely external
and not really competent authority (he dwells much

/#
on the scheme <i>de concilio</i>, as completely destroying the
freedom, and so the authority, of the Council), with
a notorious absence of any internal assent. The Archbishop
of Munich is very anxious. He told Dr[**P2: missing .] Döllinger
that the deputation which went to the Pope, begging
him to spare the Church, nearly carried its point."
#/

It is clear from this and other sources that the Archbishop
of Munich, if left to himself, had no desire to
proceed to extremities with the opponents of the Decree.
But Döllinger fully realised, ever since the first mention
of Infallibility as a subject for decision, that excommunication
lay before him if the Decree was passed.
Archbishop Scherr found himself reluctantly driven to
the painful task of imposing on the theologians a
reversal of belief similar to that which he had himself
undergone. Rome was determined that the Munich
stronghold of the minority should be brought into
line with the new Decree. The Archbishop was made
the instrument for effecting this. He wrote a letter to
the Munich Faculty of Theology, in which he said that
harassing doubts widely prevailed as to the attitude
which the Theological Faculty meant to adopt toward
the Vatican Council. It was his duty as Archbishop to
set these doubts at rest. As for himself, he frankly
owned that, during the deliberation at Rome, he gave
utterance to his own opinion with all the positiveness of
a conviction attained after mature consideration. "But,"
he added, "I never intended to retain this conviction of
mine if the decision should turn out differently." Accordingly
he invites the Theological Faculty to follow suit.
The faculty, as a body, complied. But neither Friedrich
nor Döllinger. The Archbishop waited two months.
Then he wrote entreating Döllinger to conform. To
this Döllinger replied that assent to the recent Decree
would require him to refute his lifelong historical teaching.
-----File: p319.png--------------------------------------------------------
He would have to declare that his doctrine hitherto was
false and perverted. In the face of his public declarations
no one would believe in the sincerity of his submission.
All the world would consider the transition a hypo-*critical
instance of convictions denied from fear and
personal interest. In the terribly painful situation into
which recent events had brought him, Döllinger asked
for further delay. This was granted, but, of course, to
no purpose. Just in this hour of critical suspense, when
the decisive step must be taken, came the piteous appeal
from Hefele. Was no compromise with the Archbishop
possible? That Döllinger, the first of German
theologians, should be suspended or even excommunicated;
and that by an Archbishop who had not
done a thousandth part of the service Döllinger had
rendered to the Church! This was terrible. Hefele's
letter gave Döllinger what he calls the first completely
sleepless night in his life. But it could not alter his
convictions. Döllinger sent his answer in to the Archbishop.
He took his definite and final stand on the
ancient principles. He could do no other. Döllinger
said, in his reply, that the Jesuits, in advancing their
scheme of papal absolutism, assured their adherents
and disciples, and convinced many, even Bishops, that
the noblest Christian heroism consists in the sacrifice
of the intellect, and in surrendering one's mental judgment
and self-acquired knowledge and power of discernment
to an infallible papal <i>magisterium</i> as the
only sure source of religious knowledge. This, in his
opinion, was to elevate mental sloth to the dignity of a
meritorious sacrifice, and to renounce the rights and
the claims of history.

The question of Papal Infallibility was an historical
question, which must be tested by historical investigation;
by the patient scrutiny of facts in the centuries
-----File: p320.png--------------------------------------------------------
past. If this doctrine were true, it would assuredly be
not merely one truth among many, but the actual
foundation of the rest. How could the basal principle
have been obscured through centuries?

/#
"We are still," wrote Döllinger to the Archbishop,
"waiting the explanation how it is that, until 1,830 years
had passed, the Church did not formulate into an article
of faith a doctrine which the Pope, in a letter addressed
to your Grace, calls the very foundation principle of
Catholic faith and doctrine? How has it been possible
that for centuries the Popes have overlooked the denial
of this fundamental article of faith by whole countries
and in whole theological schools? And was there a
unity of the Church when there was a difference in
the very fundamentals of belief? And--may I further
add--how is it then that your Grace yourself resisted
so long and so persistently the proclamation of this
dogma? You answer, because it was not opportune.
But can it ever be 'inopportune' to give believers the
key to the whole building of faith, to proclaim the
fundamental article on which all others depend? Are
we not now all standing before a dizzy abyss which
opened itself before our eyes on the 18th July?"
Döllinger concluded with a deliberate and emphatic
rejection of the new Decree: "As a Christian, as a
theologian, as a historian, as a citizen, I cannot accept
this doctrine."
#/

Döllinger's biographer assures us that this reply to
the Archbishop of Munich brought Döllinger hundreds
of letters, telegrams, addresses from Germany, Austria,
and Italy, in congratulation for his firmness and strength.
The Archbishop was in great perplexity. He sent a
telegram to Rome asking what his next move should
be. Antonelli replied promptly and curtly that the
whole affair was exclusively within the Archbishop's
jurisdiction. This cut off all delay and all retreat.
-----File: p321.png--------------------------------------------------------
Archbishop Scherr was thus driven forward from Rome,
and reluctantly forced to take the final step. A protest
signed by forty-three Catholic professors against
episcopal tyranny was naturally without effect. So also
was an appeal with many thousands of signatures.
Theological students in Munich diocese were now
forbidden to attend his lectures; and he was informed
that although the Archbishop could not prevent his
lecturing, yet he could only continue to do so in open
opposition to his Bishop. This was followed a fortnight
later by his formal excommunication, in which his
biographer, Friedrich, was included.[1]

The exasperation at Munich is shown in a strongly
worded protest[2] issued at Whitsuntide 1871, in which
the signatories declare themselves confirmed in refusing
the Vatican Decree by the duty, which neither Popes
nor Bishops can dispute, of abiding in loyalty to the
ancient faith even though an angel should teach them
otherwise. It has been hitherto no doctrine of the
Church, no part of Catholic faith, that every Christian
possesses in the Pope an absolute overlord and master,
to whom he is directly and immediately subjected, and
whose decisions in faith and morals he is bound under
penalty of eternal damnation to obey. It is notoriously
no part of the teaching of the Church hitherto that the
gift of Infallibility is entrusted to one individual. Peter
speaks unmistakably to us in Scriptures through his
deeds and his words and his letters; but all these breathe
a totally different spirit from that of papal absolutism.
The German minority Bishops show their bewilderment
in their Pastoral letters. For none of them can
induce themselves to follow Manning and the Jesuits
in interpreting the Decrees in their natural obvious

[Footnote 1: 17th April 1871. See <i>Declarations</i>, p. 113.]

[Footnote 2: Von Schulte, <i>Der Altkatholicismus</i>, pp. 16-22.]
-----File: p322.png--------------------------------------------------------
meaning. Moreover, the undersigned deplored that the
Bishops are not ashamed to answer the conscientious
outcry of their own dioceses with invectives against
reason and learning. In previous centuries, when
Bishops resorted to excluding a man from the Church,
they did so on the ground of the novelty and untraditional
character of his teaching. It was reserved for
the present generation to see, what eighteen centuries
have never beheld, a man condemned and excluded
precisely because he clings to a doctrine which his
fathers in the Church have taught him; refuses to
change his faith as a cloak might be exchanged. That
an unjust excommunication can only injure its inflicters--not
the individual upon whom it is inflicted--is the
universal teaching of the Fathers. Such excommunications
are as invalid and ineffective as they are unjust.
They cannot deprive the believer of the means of grace,
nor a priest of his right to dispense them.

Such was the strain in which the Munich protest was
written. Among the signatures which follow are those
of Döllinger, Lord Acton, and Reinkens, afterwards
Bishop of the Old Catholic Communion. The German
Catholics, whom the Decree of Infallibility had excluded,
gathered to form the Old Catholic Community.

Döllinger confesses that he had no hope whatever
that under the next or one of the next Popes any
important or essential change would be made for the
better, since the order of the Jesuits formed the soul and
sovereign of the whole Roman Church. Formerly there
were counterbalancing influences: powerful religious
orders, full of vitality, correcting the tendencies of the
followers of Loyola. But these had become either
powerless shadows, or satellites of the Jesuit dominating
body.
-----File: p323.png--------------------------------------------------------

/#
"The tendency of events since 1870 was shown," said
Döllinger, "in the solemn proclamation of Liguori as
Doctor of the Church:--

"A man whose false morals, perverse worship of the
Virgin, constant use of the grossest fables and forgeries,
make his writings a storehouse of errors and falsehoods.
In the whole range of Church history I do not know
a single example of such a terrible and pernicious confusion."
#/

The public papers repeatedly announced Dr
Döllinger's reconciliation with the Roman Communion.
On one occasion he replied:--

/#
"This is now the fourteenth time that my submission
has been announced by Ultramontane papers; and it
will often occur again. Rest assured that I shall not
dishonour my old age with a lie before God and man."
#/

Ten years after the Vatican Decision, Döllinger
received a pathetic, imploring appeal from a lady of
high social position, entreating him to rescue himself
from the everlasting destruction which his exclusion
would entail, and to have mercy on his own unhappy
soul.

Döllinger's answer is memorable:--

/#
"I am now in my eighty-first year, and was a public
teacher of theology for forty-seven years, during which
long period no censure, nor even a challenge that I
should defend myself, or make a better explanation,
has ever reached me from ecclesiastical dignitaries,
either at home or abroad. I had <i>never</i> taught the
new Articles of Faith advanced by Pius IX. and his
Council.... Then came the fatal year, 1870.... It
was in vain that I begged them to let me remain
by the faith and confession to which I had hitherto
been faithful without blame and without contradiction.
Yesterday still orthodox, I was to-day a heretic worthy
of excommunication; not because I had changed my
#/
-----File: p324.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
teaching, but because others had considered it advisable
to undertake the alteration, and to make opinions into
Articles of Faith."
#/

But why not make a sacrifice of his intellect:--

/#
"Because," says Döllinger, "if I did so in a question
which is for the historical eye perfectly clear and unambiguous,
there would then be no longer for me any
such thing as historical truth and certainty; I should
then have to suppose that my whole life long I had been
in a world of dizzy illusion, and that in historical matters
I am altogether incapable of distinguishing truth from
fable and falsehood."
#/

But this would undermine his whole confidence in
historic fact, and thereby shatter the foundation of his
religion. For it is on historic facts that Christianity
itself reposes. Prior to the historic problem of the
Papacy is the historic problem of the Apostolic times.
"I must first be convinced that the principal events
narrated in the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles
are essentially true and inviolable." And to destroy
confidence in historic judgment in one case is to ruin
its validity in all others.

Archbishop Scherr was succeeded in the diocese of
Munich in 1878 by Von Steichele, a former pupil of
Döllinger, and attached to him by feelings of the deepest
veneration. Von Steichele made overtures for Döllinger's
reconciliation with the Papacy. He wrote in 1879 a
delightful letter:--

/#
"With the thankfulness of a pupil to a venerable
teacher; with the respect of a disciple for the honoured
bearer of the richest knowledge; with the love of an
anxious Bishop for the brother who unhappily is
not yet at one with him in things of highest moment."
#/
-----File: p325.png--------------------------------------------------------

Döllinger sent a frank but decided reply. Return
was impossible. He said that his excommunication had
been unjust, his treatment unexampled in the history
of the Church. The mediæval theory of excommunication
rendered the individual liable to bodily harm.
It would appear that this theory was not obsolete;
for the chief of the police had warned him to be on
his guard, as they had knowledge that an act of violence
was plotted against him. Friedrich says elsewhere that
the house in which he and Döllinger lived, was specially
protected by the police for a year after the excommunication.
These dangers, said Döllinger, were long since
past. But he could not enter again into relationship
with the authors of these actions. He had long ago
challenged his former colleagues to know how they
reconciled acceptance of the Vatican expositions with
their conscience and their knowledge of the facts:--

/#
"The answer was always an evasive one, or an embarrassed
shrug of the shoulder. They said that this
was a question of detail, which the individual priest or
layman did not need to enter into. Or they said that
the very essence and merit of believing consisted
precisely in giving oneself up blindly and implicitly
to the powers that be, and in leaving it to them to
settle any contradictions that might exist. I do not
need to tell you what an impression deplorable subterfuges
of this kind have made upon me."
#/

This was Döllinger's final attitude toward the Roman
Communion up to the last moment of consciousness
on earth. He never by any act of will deviated from
testimony to the Church's traditional Faith, in which
the theory of Papal Infallibility was not included. To
the end of his days he held that this theory could not
possibly be reconciled with the broad facts of Christian
history.
-----File: p326.png--------------------------------------------------------


V

The new decree was profoundly uncongenial to the
mind of Lord Acton. He had already expressed his
sense that recent developments of papal authority were
inconsistent with the earlier principles of Christendom,
and disastrous alike to freedom of investigation, and
to the real interests of the Church. Manning's theories
on papal sovereignty were a trial to Lord Acton's
historical intellect. Manning simply reproduced the
mediæval exaggerations of temporal power which had
done incalculable mischief ever since Boniface VIII.
endorsed them in his struggle with France.

/#
"You are certainly not too severe on Manning's
elaborate absurdities," wrote Lord Acton;[1] "I had
no idea he had gone so far.... It is impossible to
exaggerate the danger of such doctrines as his. I
wish you would take the line of Catholic indignation a
little."
#/

While the Council sat, Lord Acton was in Rome,
where popular opinion ascribed the Articles in the
<i>Augsburg Gazette</i> to his instrumentality. "People
do not venture to proceed against Acton," wrote
Gregorovius;[2] "but it is known that he writes, and that
he pays highly for the materials that are supplied him."

Archbishop Manning had positive knowledge that
Lord Acton was in constant communication with Mr
Gladstone, supplying him with information hostile to
the Council; "poisoning his mind," as Archbishop
Manning phrases it, against Papal Infallibility and the
Pope's friends and supporters. Lord Acton, as a friend
and disciple of Dr [**P2: missing .] Döllinger, had great influence with

[Footnote 1: <i>Lord Acton and his Circle</i>, pp. 211, 212, 215.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Roman Journals</i>, p. 356.]
-----File: p327.png--------------------------------------------------------
the German Bishops, who, for the most part belonged
to the Opposition; and was also on confidential terms
with Mgr. Darboy, Archbishop of Paris, and with
the Bishop of Orleans, and had not a little to do
with bringing into closer union the Bishops of France
and Germany. He was also active in furnishing the
Opposition with Dr Döllinger and Professor Friedrich's
historical criticisms of the Papacy. Lord Acton, as
Manning knew well,[1] did more than any other man,
except the Bishop of Orleans, in exciting public feeling,
especially in Germany and England, against the
Vatican Council.

When, therefore, the Vatican Decree was passed and
the process of reducing objectors to uniformity began,
it was scarcely probable that Lord Acton would be left
unchallenged. Nor did he continue silent. He published
a sketch of the history of the Vatican Council[2] which,
while confined strictly to facts, must have been supremely
distasteful to the victorious side. When he said that
Pius was bound up with the Jesuits; made them a
channel for his influence and became himself an instrument
of their designs; when he gave illustrations
of authority overriding history, and the unscrupulous
suppression of uncongenial facts; when he quoted at
length Montalembert's emphatic letter on the transformation
of Catholic France into an anti[**ante]-chamber
of the Vatican--he was recording what was calculated
to advance the other side. Yet, of course, the registration
of adverse facts is a different province from personal
belief.

But Acton went so far as to describe the Infallibility
doctrine as independent of reason or history.

[Footnote 1: Purcell's <i>Manning</i>, ii. p. 434.]

[Footnote 2: Acton, <i>Vatican Council</i>. München (1871).]
-----File: p328.png--------------------------------------------------------

/#
"The sentiment," he wrote,[1] "on which Infallibility
is founded could not be reached by argument, the weapon
of human reason; but resided in conclusions transcending
evidence, and was the inaccessible postulate rather
than the demonstrable consequence of a system of religious
faith." The opponents were, according to Acton,
"baffled and perplexed by the serene vitality of a view
which was impervious to proof....

"No appeal to revelation or tradition, to reason or
conscience, appeared to have any bearing whatever on
the issue."
#/

This persistent attempt to render authority independent
of evidence was, if especially prominent in
the Infallibility disputes, a deeply seated and long
existing disease. It pervaded the theological school
then dominant in Rome, but it had, according to Acton,
exerted its baneful influence over the Roman Church
for centuries. The Jesuit theologian, Petavius, in the
seventeenth century supported existing authority at
the expense of the past.

/#
"According to Petavius, the general belief of Catholics
at a given time is the word of God, and of higher
authority than all antiquity and all the Fathers.
Scripture may be silent, and tradition contradictory,
but the Church is independent of both. Any doctrine
which Catholic divines commonly assert, without proof,
to be revealed, must be taken as revealed.... In this
way, after Scripture had been subjugated, tradition
itself was deposed; and the constant belief of the past
yielded to the general conviction of the present. And
as antiquity had given way to universality, universality
made way for authority."
#/

Thus in Acton's view the dominant school in the
Roman Church were resolved that "authority must
conquer history." He went so far as to say that:--

[Footnote 1: <i>History of Freedom</i>, pp. 512, 513.]
-----File: p329.png--------------------------------------------------------

/#
"Almost every writer who really served Catholicism
fell sooner or later under the disgrace or the suspicion
of Rome." Also that "the division between the Roman
and the Catholic elements in the Church made it hopeless
to mediate between them."
#/

Acton's description of the Vatican Assembly itself
could only leave one conclusion as to its methods
and impartiality, on the reader's mind. He records
how the Bishops on arriving in Rome, were "received
with the assurance that nobody had dreamt of defining
Infallibility, or that, if the idea had been entertained
at all, it had been abandoned." He records the Pope's
assurance that "he would sanction no proposition that
could sow dissension among the Bishops." He asserts
that the freedom of the Bishops was taken away by
the regulations of the Bull <i>Multiplices inter</i> imposed
upon them without their consent, and with refusal even
to allow their protests to be uttered. He says that
many Bishops were "bewildered and dispirited," by
the character of these Regulations. He says:--

/#
"It was certain that any real attempt that might be
made to prevent the definition could be overwhelmed
by the preponderance of those Bishops whom the
modern constitution of the Church places in dependence
on Rome."
#/

He reveals his sympathies in the strongest way by
pouring out his moral indignation on the minority
Bishops for their weakness.

/#
"They showed no sense of their mission to renovate
Catholicism....

"They were content to leave things as they were, to
gain nothing if they lost nothing, to renounce all premature
striving for reform if they could succeed in
avoiding a doctrine which they were as unwilling to
discuss as to define."
#/
-----File: p330.png--------------------------------------------------------

The contemplation of all this causes Acton to write:--

/#
"The Church had less to fear from the violence of
the majority than from the inertness of their opponents.
No proclamation of false doctrines could be so great a
disaster as the weakness of faith which would prove that
the power of recovering the vital force of Catholicism
was extinct in the Episcopate."
#/

And then Acton traces the gradual tightening of the
cords as the feeble and unhappy minority are more
and more overcome. The new Regulations determined
that decrees should be carried by majority. They
could not be accepted by the minority without virtual
admission that the Pope must be infallible. For

/#
"If the act of a majority of Bishops in the Council,
possibly not representing a majority in the Church,
is infallible, it derives its Infallibility from the Pope."

"But it was a point which Rome could not surrender
without giving up its whole position. To wait for
unanimity was to wait for ever, and to admit that a
minority could prevent or nullify the dogmatic action
of the Papacy was to renounce Infallibility. No alternative
remained to the opposing Bishops but to break
up the Council."
#/

This was exactly where their courage failed them[**.]
They protested, but submitted. And here comes Acton's
judgment on their submission:--

/#
"They might conceivably contrive to bind and limit
dogmatic Infallibility with conditions so stringent as
to evade many of the objections taken from the
examples of history; but in requiring submission to
Papal Decrees on matters not Articles of Faith, they
were approving that of which they knew the character,
they were confirming without let or question a power
they saw in daily exercise, they were investing with
new authority the existing Bulls, and giving unqualified
#/
-----File: p331.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
sanction to the Inquisition and the Index, to the
murder of heretics and the deposing of kings. They
approved what they were called on to reform, and
solemnly blessed with their lips what their hearts knew
to be accursed."
#/

The effect of this moral feebleness on the Roman
authorities was, says Acton, that

/#
"the Court of Rome became thenceforth reckless in
its scorn of the opposition, and proceeded in the belief
that there was no protest they would not forget, no
principle they would not betray, rather than defy the
Pope in his wrath. It was at once determined to bring
on the discussion of Infallibility."
#/

Lord Acton's objections to the Infallibility school
were clearly of a triple character. In relation to
History: it betrayed a resolve to instate Authority
independently of proof. It was the product of indifference
to fact. "The serene vitality of a view impervious
to proof," could only shock and distress a profound
veneration for the actual. To those who build on facts
such disregard for evidence must appear as building
without foundation. In relation to method: if the
origin of the doctrine was insecure, no less unsatisfactory
was the method by which it was decreed. Acton's
description makes the Decree the product of cowardly
weakness on the one side, and unscrupulous coercion
on the other. The spiritual value of the result
obtained might be measured by the immorality of
the means employed. It could not, it did not, enlist
his loyalty or command his reverence. In relation
to results: plainly Acton did not believe that the
limitless exaltation of Authority was beneficial, or that
it could lead to anything but results disastrous to the
real interests of the Church. The severity of his
-----File: p332.png--------------------------------------------------------
judgment on the minority, for investing with new
Authority the Papal Decree, was born of a deep conviction
that already, on countless occasions, that
Authority had proved excessive, injurious to the
advance of truth, and the freedom of the individual.
It is probably quite correct that Acton's objections
were more on the moral and political or social side
than on the strictly theological. But his sharp distinction
between the Catholic and the Roman elements
within the Church is really a distinction in dogmatic
principles. And nothing can exceed his loathing for
principles commonly known as Ultramontane. Acton
and Manning stand at the opposite poles in their
anticipations of the results of the dogma of Infallibility.

But Lord Acton went far beyond all this. He
wrote a letter[1] to a German Bishop reproaching the
minority with inconsistency in discontinuing their
opposition after the Infallibility Decree was published.
In this letter he gives the actual language of the leaders
of the minority, and concludes--

/#
"The Council is thus judged by the lips of its most
able members. They describe it as a conspiracy against
truth and rights. They declare that the new dogmas
were neither taught by the Apostles nor believed of the
Fathers."
#/

This letter was described by the <i>Dublin Review</i>[2] as
"an open and decisive revolt against the Church."

Yet it does not appear that the writer was challenged
to express his adhesion to the new Decree. But Lord
Acton's letters during this period are yet to be published.
Abbot Gasquet[3] omits all the critical years from

[Footnote 1: <i>Sendschreiben an einen Deutschen Bishof</i> (September 1870).]

[Footnote 2: N.S. vol. xvi. (1871), p. 212.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Lord Acton and his Circle.</i>]
-----File: p333.png--------------------------------------------------------
1869-1874. Lord Acton, however, did not ultimately
escape unchallenged. He was not in Manning's
Diocese or we may feel fairly certain that the Archbishop
of Westminster would have pounced upon him.

Meantime Mr Gladstone argued that the Vatican
Decrees involved political consequences adverse to
modern freedom.[1] The Church's power to employ
coercion was asserted by the Syllabus, and acknowledged
by Newman.[2] Now that such consequences could be
drawn from the Vatican Decrees Lord Acton did not
dream of denying.[3] Gladstone's argument could not be
met by denial. And, of course, the whole sympathies of
Acton's mind were with Gladstone so far as repudiation
of the use of coercive force in religion is concerned.
Nothing in the world roused Acton's moral indignation
more than Inquisition and Liguori's ethics. He admitted
with characteristic sincerity that "Gladstone had not
darkened the dark side of the question." All he could
answer was that it does not follow that inferences which
<i>can</i> be drawn <i>will</i> actually be made. He held that
"the Council did not so directly deal with these matters
as to exclude a Catholic explanation." The Council had
not so acted "that no authentic gloss or explanation
could ever put those perilous consequences definitely
out of the way." This was certainly a curious defence
of an Ecumenical Decree. It does not exclude a
Catholic explanation. But this was all he could say.
He could not even say what that true explanation was;
for on that ground his own authorities might reject
him. "I could not take my stand, for good or evil, as
an interpreter of the Decrees, without risk of authoritative
contradiction." This attitude, says Acton, "was

[Footnote 1: <i>Vaticanism</i>, p. 77.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 77.]

[Footnote 3: Gasquet, <i>Lord Acton and his Circle</i>, p. 366.]
-----File: p334.png--------------------------------------------------------
no attack on the Council, although it was an attack
on Ultramontanism."[1]

But Lord Acton proceeded to defend the Council in
the <i>Times</i> newspaper[2] from Mr Gladstone's inferences.

/#
"I affirmed that the apprehension of civil danger
from the Vatican Council overlooks the infinite subtlety
and inconsistency with which men practically elude the
yoke of official uniformity in matters of opinion."
#/

And, as an illustration of this infinite subtlety in
eluding authority, he quoted the example of Archbishop
Fénelon, who "while earning admiration for his humility
under censure [by the Pope] had retained his former
views unchanged." Fénelon wrote:--[3]

/#
"I accept this Brief ... simply absolutely and
without shadow of reserve. God forbid that I should
ever be remembered except as a pastor who believed it
his duty to be more docile than the humblest of his
sheep, and who placed no limit to his submission."
#/

Three weeks later Fénelon wrote to a friend:--

/#
"I acknowledge no uncertainty either as to the
correctness of my opinions throughout or as to the
orthodoxy of the doctrine which I have maintained....
Unless competent persons rouse themselves in
Rome the faith is in great danger."
#/

It was no more than natural, after such public letters,
that Lord Acton should be called in question by the
authorities of his Communion. It was asserted in the
Roman Church that he did not believe the Vatican
Decrees. Manning wrote to enquire what construction

[Footnote 1: Gasquet, <i>Lord Acton and his Circle</i>, p. 366.]

[Footnote 2: 24th November 1874.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Pastoral</i> (1699).]
-----File: p335.png--------------------------------------------------------
he placed upon them in order that the minds of the
multitude might be reassured. A curious and very
instructive correspondence[1] ensued. Lord Acton took
advice as to the answer he should give.

/#
"The great question is," he wrote privately to a friend,
"whether I ought to say that I <i>submit</i> to the acts of this
as of other Councils, without difficulty or examination
(meaning that I feel no need of harmonising and reconciling
what the Church herself has not yet had time
to reconcile and to harmonise), or ought not the word
<i>submit</i> to be avoided, as easily misunderstood."
#/

After further reflection Lord Acton proposed to say:--

/#
"I do not reject--which is all the Council requires
under its extreme sanctions. As the Bishops who are
my guides have accepted the decrees, so have I. They
are a law to me as much as those at Trent, not from
any private interpretation, but from the authority from
which they come. The difficulties about reconciling
them with tradition, which seem so strong to others, do
not disturb me a layman, whose business it is not to
explain theological questions, and who leaves that to
his betters.[2]

"Manning ... says he must leave the thing in the
hands of the Pope, as everybody tells him I don't believe
the Vatican Council. He means, it seems to me, that
he simply asks Rome to excommunicate me--a thing
really almost without example and incredible in the
case of a man who has not attacked the Council, who
declares that he has not, and that the Council is his law,
though private interpretations are not, whose Diocesan
has, after enquiry, pronounced him exempt from all
anathema."[3]
#/

Against Lord Acton no further action was taken.

[Footnote 1: <i>Lord Acton and his Circle</i>, pp. 359, 360, 364.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 364.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 368.]
-----File: p336.png--------------------------------------------------------
The disastrous effect of the excommunication of
Döllinger may have made Authority cautious in the
exercise of this deadly weapon. Acton indeed submitted;
but Manning's misgivings seem more than
justified. It is difficult to define the sense in which
Acton became a believer in the new Decree. "He
remained all his life," says Bryce,[1] "a faithful member
of the Roman Communion, while adhering to the views
which he advocated in 1870."

It is quite true that Acton was not an Anglican;
he was still less a Protestant. He never joined the
old Catholic movement, and is said to have dissuaded
his friends from taking that course. But it is certain
that he was never an Ultramontane. The distinction
he drew between Catholic and Roman elements in
the Church helps to explain his own position. He
was a Catholic as opposed to the modern Roman
type.

If, as Pius IX. asserted, Catholic and Ultramontane
are synonymous, then Acton's position was precarious.
But their identity is what he persistently and firmly
denied. He considered Ultramontanism as an unhappy
and mischievous influence perverting truths and ignoring
history, speculative in its origin, and injurious in
its results. He was well aware, his historic insight made
it clearer to him than to many, that the school he resented
was a long-standing disease; that its presence
could be traced for centuries, if in a less pronounced
and virulent form than to-day. But the long-standing
nature of the disease did not shake his faith in the
certainty of a remedy, and a removal sooner or later.
He did not, it has been well said, identify the long-lived
with the eternal.

Sooner or later then, Ultramontanism, according to

[Footnote 1: <i>Biographical Studies</i>, pp. 385, 386.]
-----File: p337.png--------------------------------------------------------
Acton's views, was destined to pass away. It was
no more than a temporary, if protracted, disease from
which the Church must at length recover. Meanwhile,
therefore, he held to his post, accepting the
present discomfiture in the hope of better days;
waiting until this tyranny be overpast. He had no
thought of departure. The Roman Communion was
the Church of his birth and of his devotional affinities.
He spoke of it reverentially as "the Church whose
communion is dearer to me than life."[1] He would
never have left it of his own accord. But, while
wholly identified with the ancient Catholic conceptions,
he absolutely repudiated the principles of the Ultramontane.
By what process he retained his place
while Döllinger was exiled seems not altogether clear.
Acton felt acutely the possibility that, like Döllinger,
he also might be cast out.

Whether wisdom or prudence or diplomacy refrained
from him and let him alone, there at any rate he
lived and died. But the legitimacy or consistency of his
position was the theme of a fierce and bitter controversy
in the Roman journals after he was dead.

So the great struggle in the Roman Communion
between the episcopal and the papal conceptions of
Authority, the collective and the individual, came to an
end. Every Bishop of the minority submitted. This
is a magnificent tribute to the power of Rome. It
held its defeated Episcopate in unbroken unity. Only
the old Catholic movement created an independent
community. But when the motives are considered
which induced the minority to yield, the strongest
principle appears to be the maintenance of external
unity. The abler minds resisted, after the Decree

[Footnote 1: Letter to the <i>Times</i>.]
-----File: p338.png--------------------------------------------------------
was known, so long as resistance was possible. Only
when the presence of threatened excommunication drew
them to an ultimate decision, the Bishops submitted,
with what grace they could, to a Decree which they
dared no longer resist. But the submission is, even
then, cautious, reluctant, and reserved. In some
instances it is yielded in a tone of curtness or asperity.
In other instances, with comments and explanations,
in private letters, wholly inconsistent with genuine
faith. It is difficult to find in a single minority submission
the joyous devotion which is surely due to
a heaven-sent revelation of eternal truth. They do
not accept the doctrine as a blessed enlightenment,
but rather as a heavy burden to which they are
unwillingly obliged to coerce their priests. They do
not appear like men whose intensity of conviction
enables them to say:--"It seemed good to the Holy
Ghost and to us." They would infinitely sooner ask
no questions, if Rome would only let them. They are
driven to excommunicate others, much against their
will, for continuing to hold what they themselves had
taught them, and were, until recently, inwardly persuaded
was true. It is a painful and unattractive sight.
In the frankness of confidential utterances after the
event they owned with manifest sincerity that they
did not believe the Decision valid, nor the Doctrine
part of the Historic Faith. But, being forced by
Authority to choose between submission and excommunication,
they mostly preferred submission. The
choice is intelligible. They loved the Church. Taught
to regard its limits as practically identical with those
of the Kingdom of Heaven--yet certain that history
contradicted what they were now required to believe,
they were placed in the terrible dilemma of loyalty
to reason against religious interest, or to religious
-----File: p339.png--------------------------------------------------------
interest against their reason. The issue was solemn
whichever side they chose. But the prior question
which the alternative raises is this: "What is the
spiritual value of an Absolute Authority which
inflicted such an awful dilemma upon its own devoted
sons?"

CHAPTER XIX

THE INFALLIBILITY DOCTRINE


It is essential to the completeness of our exposition
that we should analyse the doctrine itself which the
Vatican Council decreed. The Vatican affirmation
is that, under certain circumstances, the Pope is infallible,
or divinely protected from error in his official
utterances on faith and morals to the whole Church.
We will omit for the present the limitations and
confine our attention solely to the Council's statement
that the Pope's Infallibility is "that with which God
was pleased to endow His Church." Thus Papal Infallibility
is considered co-extensive with the Church's
Infallibility.

But what is Infallibility? It does not imply the
granting of a new revelation. It is concerned with
the exposition of a revelation already given. It is
not equivalent to Inspiration, such as the Apostles
possessed. It is merely "assistance by which its
possessor is not permitted to err whether in the use
of the means for investigating revealed truth or in
proposing truth for human acceptance."[1] It is, according
to Newman,[2] simply an external guardianship,
keeping its recipient off from error: "as a man's
guardian angel, without enabling him to walk, might,

[Footnote 1: Hurter, <i>Compendium Theol. Dogm.</i> i. p. 283.]

[Footnote 2: Letter to the Duke of Norfolk, p. 117.]
-----File: p341.png--------------------------------------------------------
on a night journey, keep him from pitfalls in his way."
It is a guardianship saving its recipient "from the
effects of his inherent infirmities, from any chance of
extravagance, or confusion of thought."

Any serious study of Infallibility must realise that
the question is only part of a vastly larger subject,
namely, the relation of the human will to the Divine.
To describe Infallibility as "an assistance by which
the Church is not permitted to err, whether in the
use of the means for investigating revealed truth, or
in proposing truth to man's acceptance"[1] is to assume
a theory of divine coercion which awakens some of
the profoundest psychological and dogmatic problems.
It has well been said that "two conditions are required
for an authoritative decision: the use of natural
means, and a special Providence directing that use. If
the former condition be absent, the latter is simply
impossible."[2] But what is constantly forgotten in discussions
on Infallibility is this conditional nature of
all divine assistance. It is constantly assumed that
the divine assistance will overrule, even in the absence
of compliance with what are acknowledged to be
duties on the part of the recipient. There is an
obvious simplicity, there seems an edifying piety, in
saying that this endowment is an assistance by which
the recipient is "not permitted to err." But this
deliverance from error cannot be independent of the
recipient's will, and irrespective of his receptivity.

Suppose, for instance, Infallibility to be located in
a Council. It cannot act independently of certain
conditions. It might be thwarted by fear or external
constraint. Nor are merely external conditions alone
essential. There must be inward freedom to preserve

[Footnote 1: Hurter, i. p. 283.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Nineteenth Century</i> (May 1901), p. 742.]
-----File: p342.png--------------------------------------------------------
its own normal course. Many Roman Catholics complained
that the Vatican Council was so seriously
hampered, by regulations imposed upon it from without,
that conciliar freedom was thereby made impossible.
The overruling of a large minority by force of numbers
simply shook the faith of many devoted sons of the
Roman Church. They experienced the greatest difficulty,
almost insuperable, in crediting its Infallibility. Yet,
from their point of view, the Council was legitimate
in its inception, and in its constitution ecumenical.
Now, if a Council, with such beginnings, can nevertheless
suggest these misgivings to Roman minds, may not
similar misgivings arise over a papal utterance?

Suppose then Infallibility located in a single individual:
he must comply with certain conditions. Are those
conditions purely external, concerned alone with
outward formalities? Or do they include moral
qualities and inward state? What is the authority in
revelation for the assertion that a divine assistance so
completely overrules a personality that he is "not permitted
to err." The illustration of the guardian angel
preventing a fall is an illustration of external coercion,
in which the will of the guided has no share. He is
simply upheld in spite of himself. Is this the case
with the Pope in the exercise of his Infallibility? Is
the Pope's capacity to discharge so awful a function
absolutely independent of his moral and spiritual state?
Is there a suspension of the liability to self-will? Does
the personal equation go for nothing? Is it really
credible that any other person placed where Pius was
would have said the same? Do the antecedents, the
temperament, the mental furniture, in no way affect
the utterance? Grant as large a margin as we may
to the action and control of this "Divine Assistance,"
yet still beyond that margin must be a residuum where
-----File: p343.png--------------------------------------------------------
the human individuality comes into play, and shares
in producing the final result. Hence a possibility must
always exist, and it cannot be evaded, that, in a given
instance, notwithstanding compliance with external
formalities, the inward essential conditions were not
fulfilled; and consequently the result was not infallible.
Do what you will, it is impossible in human affairs to
avoid this element of insecurity, unless the human
instrument be reduced to a mere mechanism upon which
the Spirit plays as it pleases.


I

What then is the Infallibility of the Church? This
is precisely what the Council assumes as known, and
does not explain. The Infallibility of the Church has
never been authoritatively defined. It has been treated,
of course, by theologians, but never formulated by the
Church. Hence the minority in the Vatican Council
pleaded that this subject should first be discussed: as
indeed the logical order appeared to demand.

All doctrine on the Church's Infallibility will vary
according as its basis is purely <i>à priori</i> and theoretical,
or historical. These are the two methods which distinguish
all Christian thinking. We may start from
the ideal, and infer that this is what the Almighty
must have created, or we may begin with the actual,
and draw our principles from the facts.

Now the prevalent method in modern Roman theology
is the theoretical as contrasted with the critical and
historical. This method is not confined to certain
extremists. It saturates the theological writings through
and through. Starting with an ideal of the divine
purposes, it is assumed that the Almighty must have
-----File: p344.png--------------------------------------------------------
constituted the Church in a certain way; that He
must have endowed it with certain prerogatives and
certain authorities and certain safeguards and certain
supremacies; because those prerogatives and so forth
are, in the writer's ideal view, necessary to the Church's
achievement of certain ends. Then with this ideal
already in possession, controlling the imagination, and
determining the mind what it is to discover, advance
is made to the actual, to Scripture and to History;
with the result that these are found to confirm anticipations--not
it is true without difficulties, nor without
feats of agility to the bystanders simply amazing, but
yet to the complete satisfaction of the writer's mind.
Nevertheless, the result is blindness to historical reality.
No one has expressed this better than F. Ryder writing
against an extremist in 1867, but in words which
accurately describes a conviction widely prevalent in
the Roman obedience.

/#
"It is notorious that in some minds the craving for
ideal completeness is so strong as to overpower from
time to time their sense of truth, and under the influence
of this craving, without any conscious dishonesty, they
are unable to read either in the past or present world
of experience anything but what, according to their
preconceived notions, should be. Such minds, as we
might expect, have a strong instinctive dislike for
historical studies."[1]
#/

If instead of theoretical inferences from an ideal,
we take the critical and historic way, very different
conclusions may be reached as to Infallibility. If the
promises of Christ, "Lo, I am with you always," "He
shall guide you into all truth," are interpreted in the
absence of Roman preconceptions, it is evident that

[Footnote 1: Ryder, <i>Idealism in Theology</i>, p. 5.]
-----File: p345.png--------------------------------------------------------
they do not necessarily commit our Lord to the Ultramontane
conclusions. They may mean, they appear
to mean, something quite other than that. Indeed
these Ultramontane conceptions appear to be not derived
from but read into them. At any rate what Infallibility
exists in Christendom should be ascertained from the
facts of Christian history. An existence of well-nigh
two thousand years must certainly yield a safer basis
for inferences, as to the contents of the promises of
Christ, than an <i>à priori</i> theory of things which seems
to us ideal.

The Infallibility of the Church is commonly asserted
by Roman writers to be twofold. It is distinguished
as active and passive: corresponding to the familiar
division between the Church as teacher, and the Church
as taught. Active Infallibility is the prerogative of
teaching without liability to mislead. Passive Infallibility
is the advantage of being taught without liability
to be misled. Thus for all practical purposes the Infallibility
of the Church would mean the Infallibility of
the Episcopate. The laity being reduced to a position
of mere receptivity, having no active share in the
maintenance and perpetuation of Tradition.

Whether this conception is philosophic or historical is
alike open to serious doubt. In the first place, the Church
is an organism, a totality, which cannot be, except in
theory, severed into merely active and merely passive
parts. After all, there is such a thing as the collective
Christian consciousness--the mind of the Church, which
overrides all barriers of practical convenience, such as
the distinction between teacher and taught. If history
be regarded, it is impossible to doubt that the laity
has been no mere passive recipient, but largely a controller
of forms of devotion; and forms of devotion
are, after all, expressions of the rule of faith. The
-----File: p346.png--------------------------------------------------------
control which the laity had exercised over doctrines
and creeds and formulas of truth is historically
indisputable. Instances are recorded when it is said
that the heart of the people was truer than the lips
of the priests.


II

<i>The Infallibility of the Episcopate</i> has been variously
asserted and denied by Roman theologians since the
Vatican Decree. Schwane,[1] for instance, asserts that the
Episcopate assembled in Council possesses no greater
authority than when it is dispersed. Individually they
are not infallible, nor are they so collectively. Hurter,[2]
on the contrary, maintains the opposite view. The
Episcopate is the recipient of Infallibility. The Bishops
are heirs to this Apostolic prerogative because they
are the Apostles' legitimate successors. By the consent
of all antiquity, Bishops are successors of the Apostles.
As St Jerome says: "Bishops occupy among us the
Apostles' place." Accordingly, Hurter maintains that
the Episcopate is infallible not only when assembled
in Council but also when dispersed; if it teach anything
unanimously as of faith.

This doctrine he bases first on the promises of Christ,
which apply equally to the Episcopate in either condition.
Secondly, on the belief of Antiquity, which
regarded a doctrine as heretical if conflicting with the
unanimous consent of the dispersed Episcopate. Many
heresies were condemned, without assembling an
Ecumenical Council, simply by the unanimity of the
Bishops. Thirdly, the doctrine is confirmed by the
improbabilities which would follow the other view.

[Footnote 1: <i>Hist. Dogm.</i> v. p. 461.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Compendium</i>, i. p. 271ff.]
-----File: p347.png--------------------------------------------------------
For unless the dispersed Episcopate be infallible it
would follow that it has hardly ever exercised its
prerogative, since Ecumenical Councils are very rare.
Moreover, were it only infallible when assembled, its
prerogative would depend for its exercise on permission
from the secular powers; which might, and actually did,
prevent their assembling. Hurter, therefore, teaches
the Infallibility of the Episcopate whether collected
or dispersed.

It certainly must be allowed that Hurter's view is
far more helpful to the papal doctrine than Schwane's
depreciation of the Episcopate. For, if the Episcopate
possesses no Infallibility what becomes of that Infallibility
wherewith, according to the Vatican statement,
Christ has endowed His Church, and with which the
prerogative of the Pope is compared and equalised?
It is, of course, no function of ours to adjust conflicting
Roman estimates of episcopal power. But it is of
the greatest interest to all reflective Christian minds
to compare the teachings of to-day with the conceptions
of antiquity.

The doctrine of the Infallibility of the Episcopate,
when unanimous, means, if strictly analysed, that each
particular Church is summed up and represented in
its chief pastor, who voices the collective consciousness
of his people, and bears witness to the Tradition which
he has inherited and is transmitting. The testimony of
the entire Episcopate when unanimous would naturally
represent the Church's mind. The Infallibility of the
Episcopate could in the nature of the case only exist
on condition of their unanimity. It could not hold in
conflicting testimonies to contrary traditions. Hence
the ancient conviction that the dogmatic decisions of
an Ecumenical Council must of necessity be morally
unanimous, otherwise they could not claim ecumenicity.
-----File: p348.png--------------------------------------------------------
Few Roman writers of last century have enforced this
more strongly than Dr Newman. After the Vatican
Decree he wrote:--

/#
"First, till better advised, nothing shall make me
say that a mere majority in a Council, as opposed to
a moral unanimity in itself, creates an obligation to
receive its dogmatic decrees."[1]
#/

Newman, however, lived to be informed that the
notion of moral unanimity was a piece of Gallicanism.[2]

The prevalent Roman theory of to-day is that the
decision in General Councils does not depend on the
majority of votes, but always on that part which sides
with the Pope. It has been considered possible that
all the Bishops united in Council without the Pope
might be deceived, and fall into erroneous doctrine.
He would then exercise his function of strengthening
his brethren in the faith.

The Roman doctrine is that the Infallibility of Councils
does not depend upon the subsequent consent and
acceptance by the Church. Now many Councils and
Assemblies of Bishops have been held in Christendom.
Some are infallible, and some are not. How can we
distinguish the Ecumenical Infallible Council from
assemblies which do not possess this great prerogative?
Does it depend upon the presence of the entire
Episcopate? Manifestly not. Several of the Councils
acknowledged as Ecumenical or Universal consisted
of a comparatively small proportion of the entire
Episcopate. To this and similar enquiries the modern
Ultramontane returns the answer that the character
of a Council depends neither on its numbers, nor its
majorities, nor its acceptance by the Church; but
simply and solely on its endorsement by the Pope.

[Footnote 1: Letter to the Duke of Norfolk, p. 98.]

[Footnote 2: Postscript, p. 151.]
-----File: p349.png--------------------------------------------------------

Now, given the existing condition of Roman developments,
the absolutism of their monarchical system, the
practical utility of this answer is undeniable. But its
assumptions are obvious. It assumes the identity of
the Roman Communion and the Catholic Church. It
excludes all the Oriental Churches. Beyond all this
is its absolutely unhistoric character. It is impossible
with regard for history to claim that the ecumenical
character of the first four Councils rest on papal consent
and approval. The ancient test of a Council's ecumenical
and irreversible character was certainly acceptance by
the entire Episcopate. The fragment of the Episcopate
which happened to assemble in any particular place
could not of itself give complete representation to the
consciousness of the Universal Church. The endorsement
or approval of the Roman Bishop unquestionably
added great weight; but was certainly not regarded as
a substitute for the authority which a Council acquired
from universal endorsement by the entire Episcopate.
Until this acceptance was secured, the ecumenical
infallible character of a Council must, of necessity,
remain uncertain. For the Supreme Council is the
Episcopate. And until the entire Episcopate has given
its assent, the Council has not become a supreme
expression of the mind of Christendom. This, of
course, is what the modern Ultramontanes would
not admit. It would not agree with the modern condensation
and embodiment of all authority in a single
individual Bishop at Rome. But it is the doctrine of
antiquity, and it is that maintained by all the Oriental
Churches.

The substitution of papal endorsement for episcopal
unanimity as the test of an Ecumenical Council can
only be termed a tremendous revolution in the constitution
of the Catholic Church.
-----File: p350.png--------------------------------------------------------


III

The Infallibility of the Pope is no mere isolated
dogma, separable from a system without detriment to
the remainder: it is the final conclusion and crown of
a theory of absolute authority; the completion of a
whole process of centralisation of power in the hands
and control of a monarchy. It is significant to note
that the three theories which assign Infallibility to the
Church, to the Episcopate, to the Pope, are respectively
democratic, aristocratic, monarchical. The Roman
instinct, the Imperial tendency, has shown itself in
grasping, with an undeniable tenacity and grandeur of
conception, the monarchical view. The whole drift of
Roman development for centuries had been towards
centralisation. Power after power became gradually
appropriated and placed under the exclusive control of
the central rule. Often this was done with the full
consent, even at the instigation of the ruled. It was
at times prompted by their loyalty and devotion. At
other times it was reluctantly yielded to an authority
which men had not the power to resist. Out of all this
accumulation of prerogatives a speculative theory of
primacy naturally grew. Texts were quoted in defence,
but they are not really the basis: nor is it possible by
any rigorous interpretation to derive the theory out of
them. No mind which was a stranger to the historic
Roman evolution could arrive at the Ultramontane
conclusions. We may take exposition of the giving
of the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven as an example.
And we quote it more especially because Hurter's
compendium is the seminarist's guide <i>par excellence</i>. In
its theories thousands of the Roman priesthood have
been, and are being trained. The keys of the kingdom,
-----File: p351.png--------------------------------------------------------
says Hurter, signify authority; full authority in the
matter which the keys concern. The keys of a city,
consigned to a victor, symbolise absolute control of
what is therein. The keys of a house, entrusted to a
servant by the master, make him the dispenser to all
within the house. The keys bestowed on Peter signify
the full power of jurisdiction over the Universal Church.
For He who bestows them possesses all power in heaven
and earth. And "whatsoever" signifies power supreme,
independent, universal, unlimited. Now mankind may
be bound in three respects: law, sin, and penalty.
Consequently this "whatsoever" must be a promise of
plenary power of three kinds: legislative, power to
bind; judicial, power in regard to sin; coercive, power
to punish. Now such a primacy as this, urges Hurter,[1]
not unnaturally, requires Infallibility. If the Roman
Pontiff possesses authority it is in order to secure unity
in the truth. If so, he ought to possess the means to
that end. He ought to have the power to require not
only external deference but internal assent to his teaching.
Unless he has this authority he cannot prevent
disagreement. For where there is no obligation to
assent there is permission to disagree. Moreover, he
must have authority universal over every individual.
Otherwise how can he maintain the Church in unity?
Now to do all this he ought to be infallible. He cannot
require internal assent to his teachings unless he is. He
cannot discharge the functions which Hurter assigns
him without it. He must possess an absolute final
irreversible power to define and demand the submission
of conscience, and this entirely independently of the
Church's consent.

So the mighty fabric becomes theoretically complete.
The actual concentration of power at Rome requires to

[Footnote 1: Hurter, i. p. 348.]
-----File: p352.png--------------------------------------------------------
be justified. To justify it there must be added the
further endowment of Infallibility. He ought to have
it, therefore he has. Can anything better illustrate the
craving after systematic completeness than this the marvellous
construction of an ideal of absolute authority,
for which the attribute of Infallibility appears logically
necessary, to make the stupendous system quite
complete?

The relation of the Pope's Infallibility to that of the
entire Episcopate has been left by the Vatican Decision
in great confusion. It may, of course, be said that time
has not yet elapsed sufficient to allow a proper readjustment
of various truths. It appears to be still acknowledged
that all antiquity is committed to belief in the
Infallibility of the entire Episcopate, whether assembled
or dispersed. It appears to be also affirmed that the
Pope alone is infallible whatever the Bishops may think,[**should be period?]
If the Pope's authority can render the minority infallible,
what becomes of the Infallibility of the entire Episcopate?

The question which Newman puts in the mouths of
the Irish Bishops of 1826 is greatly to the point:--

/#
"How," they would ask, "can it ever come to pass
that a majority of our order should find it their duty
to relinquish their prime prerogative, and to make
the Church take the shape of a pure monarchy?"[1]
#/

The real effect of the Vatican Decree upon the entire
Episcopate is to deprive them of their prime prerogative.
The Collective Episcopate is not for the modern Roman
the ultimate voice of the Church. But for the ancients,
for the contemporaries of St Vincent of Lerins, for
instance, this is exactly what it was. The fierceness of
the struggle in the Vatican was due to a consciousness
that it was a struggle for existence between two

[Footnote 1: Letter to the Duke of Norfolk, p. 13.]
-----File: p353.png--------------------------------------------------------
antagonistic conceptions of ecclesiastical authority--the
episcopal and the papal. The victory of absolute
monarchy has reduced the Episcopate to a shadow of
its primitive self. The entire Episcopate of the Roman
obedience may indeed now be assembled as listeners to
the one infallible voice; but their prime prerogative
has been transferred to another, and lost to themselves.
The Vatican Decree indeed maintains the paradox
that exclusive papal authority enhances that of the
Bishops; and, without conscious irony, appeals to the
language of Gregory the Great: "Then am I truly
honoured when others are not denied the honour due
to them." But Gregory said this when repudiating
a title which would have exalted him above his fellow
Bishops. Pius IX. repeated it precisely when asserting
a prerogative which exalts him to a height of
unapproachable isolation. Henceforth the submissive
Episcopate will accept what the lonely voice affirms.
They will add to his Infallibility the lustre of their
deference and obedience. But they will add nothing
whatever to the intrinsic character of his decision.
For, according to the new Decree, he is infallible
independently of the Bishops and in spite of them.
They may add, as it has been admirably said, a certain
pomp and solemnity to the papal definitions, but they
can in no wise affect their validity. "They are but
as the assistants at High Mass, who contribute in no
way to the essence of the sacrifice or sacrament."[1]

When Papal Infallibility is considered in relation to
the Church at large it is obvious that it presents a
wholly different object for their contemplation. Infallibility
viewed as residing in an entire Community, or
as expressed by the entire Episcopate of the Catholic
Church, makes an utterly different impression on the

[Footnote 1: Lord Halifax, <i>Nineteenth Century</i> (May 1901), p. 741.]
-----File: p354.png--------------------------------------------------------
believing mind. There is a certain vagueness, an almost
impersonal character, in a distributed Infallibility, quite
different from that embodied in a single individual.
This has been admirably expressed by Father Ryder
in a passage, which although published three years
before the Vatican Council, has not lost its force and
applicability.

/#
"Theologians," wrote Father Ryder,[1] "would not be
anxious to add the same qualifications when speaking
of the Church's Infallibility" [<i>i.e.</i>, as when speaking of
that of the Pope] "for the obvious reason that though
as Ultramontanes they might hold that as regards pronouncements
<i>de fide</i>, the Pope was on an equality with
the Church in Council, they had no idea of denying
that the Church possesses an Infallibility, not merely
when she puts on her robes of prophecy but inherent
in her very vital action, which the Pope by himself
does not; that as Perrone says ... clearly speaking
of the Church dispersed, she is our infallible guide <i>viva
voce et praxi</i>, which the Pope is not; that the human
authority of the Church, founded on numbers, holiness,
wisdom, etc., being infinitely greater than the human
authority of a Pope, who need be neither wise nor holy;
the Church might settle without provoking doubt, and
still less opposition, a number of border questions,
which the Pope could not. The Ultramontane
theologians had narrowed the base, so to speak, of
ecclesiastical authority; they had made it centre in an
individual, subject to numberless accidents of individual
temper and circumstance; and therefore it was of vital
importance that they should distinguish sharply the
Divine from the human element, the objects as to
which they claimed for the Pope certain Infallibility,
from those as to which they could not prove that
he was not fallible. They had to meet numberless[P2**numerous?] historical
objections, plausible at least, grounded upon
the apparent mispronouncements of Popes in <i>materiâ</i>
#/

[Footnote 1: <i>Idealism in Theology.</i>]
-----File: p355.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
<i>fidei</i>, and they dared not undertake the defence of more
than it was necessary for their position to defend, or
than they could defend satisfactorily."[1]
#/

This passage draws out with remarkable force the
distinction between the Infallibility of an institution
and that of an individual. It raises the question
whether the two can ever really be entirely identical in
scope. It therefore suggests that uncertainties attend
upon the Vatican statement of their equivalency. Can
the Infallibility of a world-wide Communion be the same
as that embodied in a single individual? Certainly
in any case the impression created upon the devout
by the one cannot be the same as that created by the
other. Men will inevitably expect and demand from
an individual Infallibility what they will never dream
of acquiring from a collective.

CHAPTER XX

WHERE ARE THE INFALLIBLE DECISIONS?


Nearly forty years have elapsed since the recognition
of the Infallibility of the head of that vast Communion.
The dogma was pushed through admittedly to enable
authority to meet by the rapidity of its decisions the
speed of modern life. Authority, however, with admirable
discretion, has not once availed itself of its newly decreed
prerogative within the last fifty years. Since Pius IX.
expired, authority has spoken many times; but never
once on the levels of unalterable decree. Certainly this
development of history is very different from the future,
as the advocates of 1870 pictured it. The practical
utility of the new Decree has been, if any, purely
retrospective, historic. It applies, according to the
Roman theologians, to utterances prior to that decision,
not since. What the future may produce it is impossible
to say. Whether a long series of supreme irreversible
pronouncements are yet to issue, or whether the supreme
prerogative will be kept in abeyance is a speculative
enquiry of the greatest interest.

It has been the function of Roman writers, since the
passing of the Vatican Decree, to apply the definition
as a test to the papal utterances of nineteen hundred
years, in order to ascertain which of those utterances
comply with its requirements, which of those are
-----File: p357.png--------------------------------------------------------
infallible, and which are not. The prerogative must,
of course, if true to-day be true of all the Christian
centuries. Infallibility must be co-extensive with the
existence of the Papacy. Consequently the papal
utterances of all history must be sifted and classified
in accordance with the Vatican Definition. It remains
therefore for us to ascertain from Roman writers the
outcome of their research, and to learn from them upon
what precise occasions they consider that a Pope has
complied with the conditions necessary to give his
pronouncement this supreme unalterable authority.


I

The conditions required to make a papal utterance
infallible are variously described. Bishop Fessler, who
as Secretary of the Vatican Council, may be presumed,
as being the Pope's selection, to have understood the
papal mind, and whose position indisputably afforded
him peculiar, if not unique, advantages, has laid it down
that the tests of an infallible papal utterance are two.
The first is that the subject-matter must be a doctrine
of faith or morals; the second, that the Pope must
express his intention, by virtue of his supreme teaching
power, of declaring this particular doctrine a component
part of the truth necessary to salvation revealed by
God, and as such to be held by the whole Church. This
was Secretary Fessler's declaration[1] almost immediately
after the Decision, and published expressly to reassure
and conciliate the alarmed and offended.

More usually in recent Roman theological works the
conditions are somewhat more elaborately analysed as
being four in number.

[Footnote 1: Fessler, <i>True and False Infallibility</i>, p. 51.]
-----File: p358.png--------------------------------------------------------

1. First, as concerns the utterer. He must speak
as Pope, and not as a theologian. That is he must
exercise his supreme authority over Christians.

2. Secondly, as to the substance of the utterance. It
must be a doctrine of faith or morals.

3. Thirdly, concerning the form of the utterance. It
must not be merely advice or warning, but dogmatic
definition. It must definitely intend to terminate a
controversy, and to pronounce a final sentence upon it.

4. Finally, as to the recipients. While it need not
necessarily be addressed to all believers, and may indeed
be directed to a single individual, yet it must be virtually
intended for every member of the Universal Church;
because it is defining something essential to be believed.

These four restrictions which appear to be generally
acknowledged more or less by Roman writers, are
obviously very powerful sifters of papal decrees. They
exclude wholesale entire classes of papal utterances
from possessing any sort of claim to the supreme
authority.

Thus, for example, one theologian says:--

/#
"Neither in conversation, nor in discussion, nor in
interpreting Scripture or the Fathers, nor in consulting,
nor in giving his reasons for the point which he has
defined, nor in answering letters, nor in private deliberations,
supposing he is setting forth his own opinion, is
the Pope infallible."[1]
#/

Fessler himself excludes from the range of Infallibility:
papal actions in general, for actions are not utterances;
all that the Popes have said in daily life; books of
which they may be the authors; ordinary letters;
utterances of Popes either to individuals or to the whole
Church, even in their solemn rescripts, made by virtue

[Footnote 1: Billuart, ii. p. 110.]
-----File: p359.png--------------------------------------------------------
of their supreme power of jurisdiction in issuing disciplinary
laws or judicial decrees. None of these,
according to Bishop Fessler, are dogmatic papal
definitions or utterances of infallible authority.[1]

Newman appears to have thought that Fessler's
tendency was to underrate the Vatican Decree.

/#
"Theological language," wrote Newman, "like legal,
is scientific, and cannot be understood without the
knowledge of long precedent and tradition, nor without
the comments of theologians. Such comments time
alone can give us. Even now Bishop Fessler has toned
down the newspaper interpretations (Catholic and
Protestant) of the words of the Council, without any
hint from the Council itself to sanction him in
doing so."[2]
#/

Newman, however, did not apparently consider
Fessler's statements just quoted as a case of underestimation,
for in the following year he himself gave
a similar restriction of the range of Infallibility.

/#
"Even when the Pope is <i>in</i> the Cathedra Petri, his
words do not necessarily proceed from his Infallibility.
He has no wider prerogative than a Council, and of a
Council Perrone says: 'Councils are not infallible in
the reasons by which they are led, or on which they
rely in making their definition, nor in matters which
relate to persons, nor to physical matters which have
no necessary connection with dogma.'

"Supposing a Pope has quoted the so-called works
of the Areopagite as if really genuine, there is no call on
us to believe him; nor, again, when he condemned
Galileo's Copernicanism, unless the earth's immobility
has a 'necessary connection with some dogmatic truth,'
which the present bearing of the Holy See towards that
philosophy virtually denies."[3]
#/

[Footnote 1: Fessler, p. 65.]

[Footnote 2: Letter in 1874. <i>Life of De Lisle</i>, ii. p. 42.]

[Footnote 3: Letter to Duke of Norfolk, pp. 115, 116.]
-----File: p360.png--------------------------------------------------------

/#
"And again his Infallibility is not called into
exercise unless he speaks to the whole world; for if
his precepts, in order to be dogmatic, must enjoin
what is necessary to salvation, they must be necessary
for all men. Accordingly ... orders to particular
countries or classes of men have no claim to be the
utterances of his Infallibility."[1]
#/

This treatment of the Vatican Decree is an exercise
of what Newman calls "the principle of minimising,"
which he considers "so necessary for a wise and cautious
theology."[2]

A still further condition is introduced by Newman
to qualify the character of papal decisions. There is
the doctrine of intention. The Pope, urges Newman,

/#
"could not fulfil[P2**fulfill] the above conditions of an <i>ex cathedra</i>
utterance if he did not actually <i>mean</i> to fulfil[P2**fulfill] them....
What is the worth of a signature if a man does not consider
what he is signing? The Pope cannot address his
people East and West, North and South, without meaning
it; ... nor can he exert his apostolical authority
without knowing that he is doing so; nor can he draw
up a form of words and use care, and make an effort
in doing so accurately, without intention to do so."
#/

Newman himself applied this principle of intention
to the case of Honorius.

/#
"And therefore no words of Honorius proceeded
from his prerogative of infallible teaching, which were
not accompanied with the intention of exercising that
prerogative."[3]
#/

That, of course, must apply to every individual for
whom the infallible prerogative is claimed. The

[Footnote 1: Newman, Letter to Duke of Norfolk, p. 120.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 120.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 108.]
-----File: p361.png--------------------------------------------------------
classification of papal utterances is accordingly involved
in the doctrine of intention. It will be necessary in
every case to ascertain what the Pope's intentions were.
Now of all intricate and desperately difficult problems
none surpass the doctrine of intention. No wonder
then if there will be discordant verdicts among the
theologians, and a large element of insecurity.


II

Following upon this analysis of the theoretical conditions
requisite for infallible utterances comes the
practical enquiry, to what particular papal decrees do
these conditions really apply? Upon what precise
occasions did the Pope bestow upon the Church the
advantages of his Infallibility? This is a question
upon which theologians are much more reticent. They
deal at considerable length with the necessary conditions
which such an utterance would require, but
many among them refrain from all practical application.
They do not indicate which among the immense
collections of papal documents really possesses this
supreme distinction. Newman, indeed, says that the
Pope "has for centuries upon centuries had and used
that authority which the Definition now declares ever
to have belonged to him."[1] According to this assertion
the Pope has not only possessed this power, but "used
it." The implication appears to be that since he has
possessed it for centuries upon centuries he has used
it frequently. Newman, however, quotes with approval
the statement that "the Papal Infallibility is comparatively
seldom brought into action."[2] Indeed, he
himself observes:--

[Footnote 1: Letter to Duke of Norfolk, p. 128.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 125.]
-----File: p362.png--------------------------------------------------------

/#
"Utterances which must be received as coming from
an Infallible Voice are not made every day, indeed
they are very rare; and those which are by some
persons affirmed or assumed to be such, do not always
turn out what they are said to be."[1]
#/

Fessler again speaks of "the form ... which the
Pope usually adopts when he delivers a solemn definition
<i>de fide</i>."[2] And yet the result of his application of the
tests of an infallible utterance is that he "finds only
a few."[3]

To be still more precise. There is no unanimity as
to occasions when an infallible decree was given. Many
writers on Infallibility give no list at all. Those who
attempt it differ widely, but agree in regarding them
as excessively few. The Secretary of the Vatican
Council tells us that he found only a few, but he did
not tell us which they are. This is perfectly intelligible.
He wrote in the same year in which the Decree was
made, and certainly there had been no time to investigate
or apply the tests with any assurance of accuracy; and
it was most prudent and commendable not to attempt
the dangerous task of committing himself to a definite
list which might sooner or later have been overthrown.
As Newman said: "Those which are by some persons
affirmed or assumed to be such, do not always turn
out what they are said to be." More recent writers
have felt themselves justified by lapse of time in
indicating which the infallible utterances are. Whether
on Roman principles the time has really come for
indicating them with any confidence may be open to
question. The varieties in the lists would seem to
suggest a negative. They appear to vary from eight

[Footnote 1: Letter to Duke of Norfolk, p. 81.]

[Footnote 2: Fessler, p. 92.]

[Footnote 3: <i>Ibid.</i> p. 53.]
-----File: p363.png--------------------------------------------------------
instances down to one. Of course the compilers of
the lists may contend that their researches are not
yet completed. The investigation of utterances extending
over well-nigh two thousand years may well require
considerable time. The judgment may be regarded
as still in suspense. But so far as lists are given us
they vary within the limits already stated.

Cardinal Franzelin, writing in 1875, gives some
examples of utterances whose Infallibility he regards
as certain. They are four in number.

1. The Dogmatic Constitutions of the Council of
Constance against Wiclif and Hus, confirmed by
Martin V.

2. The Constitution <i>exsurge</i> of Leo X. against
Luther.

3. The Constitution of Clement XI. against the
Jansenists--the Bull <i>Unigenitus</i>.

4. The Constitution <i>Auctorem Fidei</i> of Pius VI.
against the Synod of Pistoia; wherein many pre-*positions
are condemned with various degrees of
censure.

Franzelin by no means limits Infallibility to these
four utterances. But these are all that he gives as
illustrations of its exercise. And of these he says with
perfect confidence: "It is not lawful for any Catholic
to deny that these are infallible definitions."[1]

A more recent writer, Lucien Choupin,[2] repeats
Franzelin's list, and gives four other utterances in
addition:--

1. The Decree of the Immaculate Conception.

2. The Dogma of Papal Infallibility.

Pius IX. is affirmed to have infallibly decreed his
own Infallibility.

[Footnote 1: Franzelin, <i>De Traditione</i>, p. 123.]

[Footnote 2: <i>Valeur des Decisions Doctrinales et Disciplinaires du Saint-Siège</i> (1908).]
-----File: p364.png--------------------------------------------------------

It is noteworthy that Choupin's two chief instances
belong to the pontificate of Pius IX. Historical research
enables the same writer to add two more.

3. The condemnation of the five propositions of
Jansen by Innocent X. in 1653.

4. The Constitution of Benedict XII. in 1336.

This last affirms that departed saints who need no
further cleansing possess an immediate intuitive vision
of the divine nature.[1]

To these many theologians, says Choupin, add the
<i>Encyclical Quanta Cura</i> of Pius IX. in 1864.

On the other hand, Carson in his <i>Reunion Essays</i>
says:--

/#
"These four conditions so narrow the extent of the
Petrine prerogative that it is difficult to point with
certainty to more than one, or at most two, papal
pronouncements, and declare them, with the consent
of all, to be infallible.

"The Bull <i>Ineffabilis Deus</i>, defining the Immaculate
Conception, may be considered, as we have seen, to
be a definition of doctrine about whose Infallibility
there cannot well be any question. The tome of Pope
Leo the Great on the Incarnation, sent by him to
the Council of Chalcedon, and accepted by the assembled
fathers as the echo of Peter's voice, may perhaps be
placed on the same footing. Beyond these two ecumenical
utterances on points of doctrine, we cannot
assert with any assurance that the prerogative of Papal
Infallibility has been exercised from the day of Pentecost
to the present time."[2]
#/

Certainly if the intrinsic value of a document be
any witness to its Infallibility no papal utterance has
better claim to be an instance of that stupendous
prerogative than the famous letter of Leo the Great

[Footnote 1: Denzinger, <i>Encheiridior</i>, § 456.]

[Footnote 2: Carson's <i>Reunion Essays</i>, p. 91.]
-----File: p365.png--------------------------------------------------------
to Flavian. But yet some theologians omit it from
their list of Infallibility, and here a writer who inserts
it as one of two can only do so with a hesitating
"perhaps." Remembering the theological defences of
Leo's letter we can see the reason for this uncertainty.
Theologians have felt themselves constrained by the
historic facts to admit that the Council of Chalcedon
examined the contents of Leo's letter, and, that having
satisfied themselves of its character, they then proceeded
to endorse it, and to declare that Peter spoke by Leo.
But this procedure is not thinkable in the case of an
infallible document. Accordingly it was supposed that
Leo never meant to speak infallibly, but only to suggest
the lines upon which the Council should proceed. But
this defence removed the letter from the region of
inerrable authority. Hence the most that could be
said about it was a mere perhaps.

The question has to be faced, What authority do these
lists of infallible utterances possess? They possess the
authority of the various theologians who have compiled
them. But they possess no more than that authority.
No infallible list of infallible utterances has yet appeared.
And surely whatever theories men may invent, it must
still be true that the only final way to determine whether
a papal utterance be infallible is whether it has secured
the consent of the Church.

It is, of course, acknowledged by Roman writers,
that after a careful application of the four tests it may
still be disputed, and still remain uncertain whether
the particular utterance is or is not a case of Infallibility.
In this event the rule must be that, so long as any
uncertainty exists, after serious enquiry, there is no
infallible decision.[1] Fessler, however, adds that where
uncertainty remains, the subordinate authorities will

[Footnote 1: Hurter, i. p. 407.]
-----File: p366.png--------------------------------------------------------
ask the highest authority what his intention was in
such an utterance. If the utterer expires before answering,
Fessler does not inform us what the enquirer is
to do. Is a subsequent Pope an infallible judge of
his predecessor's intentions? This we are not told.
Fessler's translator, however, adds a remark of considerable
importance.

/#
"Of course Bishop Fessler is here understood as
meaning that this fresh explanation of the definition
must be provided with all the marks which are necessary
to prove the presence of a real definition."
#/


III

Our study of the subject may be closed with a few
reflections.

What impresses us perhaps chiefly is the meagreness
of the result. Upon this point Newman observed:--

/#
"It has been objected to the explanation I have
given ... of the nature and range of the Pope's Infallibility
as now a dogma of the Church, that it was a
lame and impotent conclusion of the Council, if so much
effort was employed as is involved in the convocation
and sitting of an Ecumenical Council in order to do
so little. True if it were called to do what it did and
no more; but that such was its aim is a mere assumption.
In the first place it can hardly be doubted that there
were those in the Council who were desirous of a
stronger definition; and the definition actually made, as
being moderate, is so far the victory of those many
bishops who considered any definition on the subject
inopportune. And it was no slight point of the proceedings
in the Council, if a definition was to be, to
have effected a moderate definition. But the true
answer to the objection is that which is given by Bishop
Ullathorne. The question of the Pope's Infallibility
#/
-----File: p367.png--------------------------------------------------------
/#
was not one of the objects professed in condemning the
Council; and the Council is not yet ended."[1]
#/

The moderate character of the Definition which
Newman notes is indeed conspicuous, when compared
with the extravagant statements of Manning and Ward,
of Veuillot and the <i>Univers</i>.

An Infallibility, whose range is possibly limited to
one solitary utterance in nineteen hundred years, is
very different from the ideal of perpetual irreversible
decisions of almost daily occurrence as described by
Ward. Very different also from rapid termination of
controversies which Manning considered so necessary
to our progressive age. And there is reason to believe
that the decision, although at first accepted by the
Extremists with the wildest joy, was on maturer
reflection viewed with considerable disappointment.

But this moderation has recently been viewed as a sign
of truth. Certainly Manning would never have argued
that it was. A <i>via media</i> between two extremes, upheld
as ideal, would have been, indeed it was, Manning's
detestation.

And if the Vatican Decree is moderate relatively to
a school of extravagance, it is no less stupendous
relatively to a school of antiquity. Judged by the
conceptions of St[**missing .?] Vincent of Lerins the dogma is not
moderate, it is most extreme. If some who anticipated
and feared something much more pronounced acquiesced
in the actual dogma with comparative relief, a very
different estimate will be formed by those whose
standard of moderation is the doctrine of antiquity.

If the total advantage hitherto reaped from Papal
Infallibility be compared with that which the Church
has gained from its Ecumenical Councils, the balance

[Footnote 1: Newman's Letter to the Duke of Norfolk, p. 154.]
-----File: p368.png--------------------------------------------------------
is heavily on the side of the more ancient method
of ascertaining and formulating Christian tradition.
Whatever the solitary Infallible Voice may pronounce
in the future, it has done exceedingly little in the past,
even on Roman estimates. Those who consider the
Immaculate Conception the only instance of an irreversible
papal decision can scarcely deny that no comparison
exists between this and the work of the Council
of Nicæa. This is, of course, no argument against its
truth. It is not for a moment produced with that
design. But it is an argument against the value of
numerous pretexts which instigated many of the most
influential personages who helped to push this doctrine
through. It shows that they were controlled by
totally erroneous conceptions. It shows much more
than this. The familiar controversial statements that
the early Popes could not have spoken as they did,
had they not been conscious that they possessed Infallibility,
and a right accordingly to demand unconditional
interior submission, and intellectual assent, are shown
by Roman interpretation of the Vatican Dogma to be
absolutely valueless. And all this shows that a profound
confusion has existed in Roman minds between
Authority and Infallibility. If this distinction had been
sharply realised, many of the arguments by which the
doctrine was unsupported could never have been
employed.

The meagreness of the issue is in curious contrast
with the magnitude of the battle, and the tremendous
character of the affirmation. The question can hardly
be evaded, Was it really in the Church's interest to
impose belief in a prerogative whose exercise is
admittedly so uncertain? Is it permissible to be a
Roman Catholic while affirming that Papal Infallibility
has never yet been exercised? If it is, Where is the
-----File: p369.png--------------------------------------------------------
dogmatic gain? If it is not, Where are the indisputable
decisions? And what is its practical utility? Its
strongest advocates, as Manning, so Roman writers
themselves affirm, viewed the subject rather as statesmen
than as theologians. They upheld it, not so
much for theoretic completeness, as because it would
strengthen the Church's resources, and enable it the
better to meet the age. And yet the prerogative has
never since been utilised.

The practical effect so far has been to alienate more
grievously than ever the separated Churches of the
East. Was this in the real interests of Christendom?
It may be that, somewhat exhausted by this terrific
strife, authority is recruiting itself, and will some day
utilise its new prerogative with tremendous results;
that it is meanwhile treasuring up its new resources
against a day of need. But so far as the historic
development has hitherto advanced, it is a theoretic
rather than a practical victory. It possesses all the
intellectual problems of a new, precarious, and bewildering
dogma, without the practical gains of a prerogative
manifestly and constantly utilised in the service of
mankind.
